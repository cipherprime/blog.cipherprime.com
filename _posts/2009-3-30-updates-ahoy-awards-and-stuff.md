Right then.

So we have weeks worth of updates to give! Like Will said, weâ€™ve been pretty much slammed with customer support, and just got back from an awesome week in San Fran for the [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/). We met a ton of cool people, and weâ€™re psyched to be back with a ton of new game ideas that youâ€™ll hopefully get a sneak peek at soon.

The award looking awesome in our office

Oh yeah, we were lucky enough to win Most Creative Game of 2008 at the first annual [Flash Gaming Summit](http://www.flashgamingsummit.com/)! Iâ€¦ donâ€™t really know how that happened actually, but whatever â€” it looks awesome in the office.

Thanks so much to Mochi Media and the FGS â€” and of course, all you guys that made this possible ðŸ˜€

Moving forward, weâ€™re going to have new features and announcements coming up really soon, so keep checking back!
