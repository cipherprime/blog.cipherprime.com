Iâ€™m pleased to announce that we have rebooted [_Auditorium_](http://www.playauditorium.com) with a completely new system! Not only does this update come with smoother gameplay, faster load times, and a sleek updated look, it also lays the foundation for the full online release. Go check out the new site, and stay tuned as we get close to announcing our release date. As always, we really appreciate your feedback, so write us and let us know what you think of the new layout, as well how the game plays â€” faster, slower, etc.

P.S. The preview has been changed to include a new modifier, for anyone that cares to play around with it ðŸ˜‰
