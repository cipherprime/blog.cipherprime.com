I sure hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we’ve been running a lot of download tests today and we just weren’t happy with the results. Preorders have really picked up over the past few days, so we wanted to make sure nothing goes wrong and that everyone will have a happy fast download. Unfortunately, we were not very pleased with these results earlier in the day. Luckily, we have now reworked the downloading system and are extremely happy. All the tests we’ve done in the past few hours have been superb to say the least.

However, it’s very late over here now and we’re a bit hesitant about hitting that button. No matter how much you test, you never know what can happen. For this reason, we are holding back the Fractal Launch until tomorrow afternoon ( Tuesday, May 25th ). I cannot apologize enough. In the end, we are only trying to make sure everyone has a better experience.

We are incredibly excited and cannot wait until tomorrow afternoon! See you then!
