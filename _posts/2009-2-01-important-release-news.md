As everyone has noticed, the full release of Auditorium has not gone live yet. After completing development on our local copy, we began migration of the new system on Thursday morning. Little did we know this would launch the longest work day in Cipher Prime history — a staggering _72 hours straight_ of non-stop work from 10AM Thursday through to 10 AM this Sunday morning.  
In this time, we were beset by all manner of development demons, including uncooperative servers, a few over-eager fans, and all the ravages of sleep deprivation.

The disappointment for us is that, after all that effort, we still do not feel that the full release is quite up to our standards.

**Auditorium means so very much to us and we don’t want to disappoint you**, but we also feel it is our responsibility to learn from the past — and if the punishment our servers took when the demo was _dugg_ is any indication, we’ll have quite the storm to weather. In order to better manage the traffic that we’ll (hopefully!) receive, we have decided to do a staggered release:

**\[ February 3rd \] 11AM EST** – Auditorium will go live, and the full-version will be released directly to donators. Donators will be notified at this time with an email and authentication codes to pick up their copy.  
**\[ February 4th \] 11AM EST** – Auditorium will be released for purchase by the general public.

By staggering the release, we’ll make sure that everyone who purchases Auditorium will not get a degraded experience due to server load.

We cannot apologize enough for not going live on Friday, but we are only a two-man team, and despite what the little voices tell us, sleep is actually a good thing.

We have tried our very best, but **we must humbly ask for your forgiveness** and hope you enjoy the launch early this week. Thank you for your continuing support.
