Welcome to the Cipher Prime Blog! If you’re so inclined, you’ll be able to keep track of what’s going on here, from inane things (like what we had for lunch) to things you actually care about (like when _Auditorium_ is coming to your favorite console). Feel free to comment, post, and email us – we read everything, and the feedback lets us know you care (as trite as that sounds).
