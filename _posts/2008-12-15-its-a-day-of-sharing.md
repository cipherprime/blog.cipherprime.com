I thought it might be nice to direct you guys to some gaming gems we stumbled upon today. While neither of these games are new flash games from what I understand, they are both great.

Without further ado, from the puzzle-game genre I’d like to present to you [LaunchBall](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/launchpad/launchball/ "LaunchBall"). LaunchBall excels in so many areas it’s hard to count. The puzzles are very fun and have that unique sandbox style game play we’ve come to expect in good puzzle games today

The second title I’d like to bring to your attention is [RoboKill](http://www.rocksolidarcade.com/games/robokill/ "RoboKill"). Just as it sounds, this is your classic blow-it-up action game. The execution is just so good I had to mention it. I really enjoyed both these titles and I hope you do too. If anyone else has stumbled upon any really good flash games lately, send them our way so we can check them out too!
