[_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice) takes home **Game of the Year Runner-up** in the Mac App Store’s [Best of 2012](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?cc=us&fcId=573271270) selection! Not too shabby considering we came in second only to _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_. Lots of great games made the [Best of 2012](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?cc=us&fcId=573271270) selection, such as _Limbo_, _Bastion_, _Botanicula_, and _Dungeon Defenders_. Check ’em out!
