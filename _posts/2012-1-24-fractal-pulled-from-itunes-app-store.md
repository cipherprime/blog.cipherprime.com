Due to technical issues experienced with our publisher—namely that they are technically no longer our publisher—_Fractal: Make Blooms Not War_ has been pulled from the iTunes App Store. Don’t worry, though. The situation is only temporary. Now that publishing rights have been returned to Cipher Prime, we’ll be re-releasing _Fractal_ for the iPad under our own name. When _Fractal_ does return to the store, it will be registered as an entirely different app and will need to be downloaded to receive the latest version and any future updates. Unfortunately, there’s no way to transfer purchases in a situation like this one. Keep your eyes posted on the blog for updates!
