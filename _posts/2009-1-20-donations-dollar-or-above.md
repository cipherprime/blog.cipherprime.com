We have been trying our very best to make this a surprise, but due to the obvious concern people have shown we wanted to tackle the subject of donations.

First off, **Dain and I cannot thank you enough for your contributions**. Believe it or not, the donations have helped us quite a bit in times when we hardly had money to eat. Consider your money as an investment in a company who really cares about the games they put out. Now it’s time for us to give you that return on investment.

**For everyone who donated $5 or above, you will be able to redeem your donation for a full copy of the game.** ( \[edit\] At this time we have closed donations. ) On top of that, we will also be sending out a full audio track for the song Autumn. It seems many donators did not click the ‘back to site’ button which would have given them the track at that time. If you donated you will be receiving an email late next week before our release with instructions on how to receive your copy. It should be a pretty simple streamlined process.

_Seriously though, we love you guys. Thanks so much._
