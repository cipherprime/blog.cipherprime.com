[![](/img/blog/Cat-In-Santa-Hat.jpg "Cat-In-Santa-Hat")](/img/blog/Cat-In-Santa-Hat.jpg)There’s something about this time of year that, in spite of Philadelphia’s wickedly wintry weather, melts our hearts and fills the air with generosity.

So to share that feeling, we are pleased to announce the Cipher Prime Holiday Sale! We’ve lowered the price of both [Auditorium](http://www.playauditorium.com) and [Fractal](http://www.playfractal.com) to just **$4.99**, saving you a whopping five bucks a pop!

And if that’s not enough, you can get them [bundled together](https://store.cipherprime.com/bundles/holiday) for a mere **$7.99**! With that kind of savings, you’ll be able to send your Aunt Marion an extra fruitcake this year!

So treat yourself or a friend the gift of gleeful gaming! Sale ends December 31st!

Happy Holidays!

P.S. As always, you can send the games as gifts to your friends from your CP Store account!
