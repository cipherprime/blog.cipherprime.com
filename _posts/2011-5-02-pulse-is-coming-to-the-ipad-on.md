Apple has approved Pulse and we’re launching on 5/5!!!

Finally! Whewwwwww! We’re incredibly excited (maybe even crying)! For us, so many firsts are happening over here right now. Let’s examine the facts about Pulse:

*   our first Unity Game
*   our first self-published iOS game
*   our first Music Rhythm game
*   our first collaborative Music Game
*   our first game with our new Team Member, Kerry Gilbert
*   our first iPad game

[![](/img/blog/splash.png "splash")](/img/blog/splash-e1304345136387.png)With all this happening, we need your help! In the past, our fans have been nothing short of amazing. In fact, there’s no way we would still be making games if it wasn’t for all of you. **We know some of you don’t have iPads and can’t play Pulse; that makes us very sad =(**. However, this was a very unique concept and needed to be executed on a touch-screen tablet ( hint : we haven’t ruled out Android Tablets ).

Pulse could be a huge turning point for us. After 3 years of game development, we are still struggling every day (seriously, it sucks). We need to get out of this slump, so we can keep making great unique games. So, we need to ask your help with one thing:

**Help us spread the word about Pulse!**
========================================

Don’t do it because you love us. Don’t do it because we love you (a lot). Do it because Pulse is simply a great game by 3 lovable developers.

We’ve been getting an overwhelming response from anyone who has been able to play the game in Philly, but we need to reach out. **If you have a blog, Facebook, website, best friend, family, Digg account, reddit account, carrier pigeon, semaphore, whatever… let them know we’re about to takeover the iPad Rhythm Game Market.** Help us start the revolution, so we can keep making great games ( for many platforms ).

Promo codes, at the ready! Let’s sink this battleship!
