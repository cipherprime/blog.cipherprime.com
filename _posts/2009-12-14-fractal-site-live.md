[![](/img/blog/picture-1.png "picture-1")](/img/blog/picture-1.png)We’re pleased to announce the [official site for Fractal](http://www.playfractal.com) is finally live! We’ve been working on this baby for eight months now, and we can’t wait to let you guys get your hands on it. Where [Auditorium](http://www.playauditorium.com) was much more _experience_, _Fractal_ is definitely more _game_, and any puzzle fanatic with a penchant for combos and cascades will feel right at home. We’ve still brought our own flavor to the genre by introducing:

*   Multi-dimensional gameplay, where you create and control pieces in up to six directions at once.
*   Dynamic difficulty adjustment, so the game stays at your ideal challenge level.
*   A new reactive music system called MusicBox, that composes music on the fly based on how you play.

Head on over to [playfractal.com](http://www.playfractal.com) to check the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzrJrmcItMU) and get more details on the game! More info about release dates/platforms will be available soon on both the blog and Fractal site. Oh yeah, don’t forget we also have an [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CipherPrimeBlog) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cipherprime) feed for easy push updates. Stay tuned!
