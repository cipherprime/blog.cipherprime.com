![](/img/blog/totalgames.png "totalgames")After literally _weeks_ of waiting and hoping, we are incredibly proud to announce that _Auditorium_ has passed 1,000,000 plays! I can’t tell you how excited we are to see our creation flourish. I also can’t tell you how proud we are of our [server](http://www.mediatemple.net), which has withstood a constant flood of traffic [from](http://digg.com/playable_web_games/Crack_In_Flash_Game_Form) [several](http://digg.com/playable_web_games/PlayAuditorium_A_Beautiful_music_flash_game) [Diggs](http://digg.com/design/What_Blog), untold thousands of links, and the especially ridiculous outpouring of visitors from [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) and [VGCats](http://www.vgcats.com). Thanks to everyone who has played, and especially to those that have played more than once to see all the possibilities!
