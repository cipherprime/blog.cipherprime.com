Yesterday it was announced _Auditorium_ was the ‘[Free Indie Rapid Fire](http://www.bytejacker.com/category/episodes/rapidfire "Free Indie Rapid Fire")‘ game of the week over at [ByteJacker](http://http://www.bytejacker.com/ "ByteJacker"). I wanted to thank anyone who voted for us, you guys rock!

Meanwhile, I have some important news about beta testing. You may have noticed there is no longer a beta testing link on the _Auditorium_ site. It’s sad, but we are currently at capacity. We have received thousands of requests and are going through them all in order to come up with our awesome testing team! **For everyone who sent in an email, thank you so much and we’ll let you know as soon as we can.** The beta testing system is still being built and should be ready in just a week or two. We have a lot of surprises so I hope you’re ready!
