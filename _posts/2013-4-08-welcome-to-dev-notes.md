Welcome, Bienvenidos, Bienvenue, Willkommen, Witamy Was, Добро пожаловать, 欢迎, ようこそ, Pe’el!

[![thisisdevnotes](/img/blog/thisisdevnotes.jpg)](/img/blog/thisisdevnotes.jpg)

We’ve gotta admit it, Backers, but [we’re pretty private people](http://imgur.com/a/oZQoP). So this Dev Note Access thing is kind of a big deal for us.

We usually don’t do sneak peeks, because so much can change during the development process and we are never done until we’re done. We’re kind of sensitive to critiques (we’re even harsher on ourselves), so getting to that mythical end point doesn’t happen quickly or easily. It’s more like…what’s the word? Ah yes — painful.

But we really, really appreciate all your help! Like, REALLY appreciate it, so we’re going to suck it up and let you guys in on the process.

**Here’s what you should expect:**

*   **Weekly updates.**
    *   Every Friday, starting this Friday.
*   **A wide variety of media.**
    *   Sometimes, you’ll get blog posts. Other times, music. Pictures. _Moving_ pictures or even “_talkies_” (we’re on the bleeding edge). Downloadables. Non-downloadables. Kittens.
*   **A wide variety of content.**
    *   We’re gonna give you tech wizardry. Concept art. Timelapses. Melodies and rhythms. Stories. Fireside game design chats. Pie in the sky feature dreams. Soul crushing game development realities (e.g. ever receding deadlines). Sweet, sweet information. And even more delicious nonsense.

We can’t promise a ton of meaty content every week, because we’ll just be siphoning off precious, precious development time. But you’ll get something, and we hope it’ll pass your muster!

So stay tuned!
