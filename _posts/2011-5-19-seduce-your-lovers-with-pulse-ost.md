The Pulse: Official Soundtrack is finally released!

Seduce your lovers with 8 sexy tracks of ambient deliciousness, arranged by increasing difficulty and complexity. All our wonderful mp3 tracks, including our bonus level, “Pacemaker” (deemed too difficult to play) can be purchased off our site for 4.99 USD. No DRM!

And here’s our simple request – [though you can also purchase our soundtrack off the Apple Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/pulse-ost/id435793533), (7.92 USD) please support us by buying it from [our site](https://store.cipherprime.com/music/pulseOST)! Apple iTunes purchases only give us the fraction of the purchase price, while store purchases fund our dwindling supply of pizza.

BENEFITS OF BUYING PULSE: OST FROM OUR STORE :

–**CHEAPER $$$**

**\-supports us, the developers and the musicians!**

**\-comes with additional bonus track, “Pacemaker”**

**\-we think you’re beautiful**

We love Apple, but we love you more. **That’s why in addition to the soundtrack, an update for P****ulse will be available in about two weeks.** We have quite a bit of music in front of us to play with, so prepare yourselves; lots of awesome tracks are comin’ atcha soon!
