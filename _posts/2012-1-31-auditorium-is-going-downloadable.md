[![Auditorium Standalone Graphic](/img/blog/auditorium_blogpost_sqr_logosOnly.png "Auditorium Standalone Graphic")](cipherprime.com/games/auditorium)We’ve finally gotten around to creating a standalone version of Auditorium, and it’s heading to the Steam Store and the Cipher Prime Store! Expect to see it up in the next few weeks!

**I bought the web-based Auditorium already. So, do I get a downloadable version?**

Sure! If you are an existing purchaser, once everything is on the Cipher Prime Store and finalized on the Steam Store you will be able to redeem your game. You can download it straight from your products page.

**Is there anything new in the game? **Why are you releasing it as a standalone version?****

No, aside from a new main menu, this version of Auditorium is the same as the classic full version. This standalone release is coming because fans have been asking for this for a while, and because we’re transitioning our titles away from browser-based games.

**I’d rather just play on the PlayAuditorium.com website, can I still do that?**

Yes. However, we are going to be moving the game from the PlayAuditorium.com website to a dedicated page on the Cipher Prime website. No need to worry about that, though, because PlayAuditorium.com will automatically redirect you to the proper place!

**Will my progress from the web version be saved if I start playing on the standalone version?**

Unfortunately, no. We’re sorry! In addition to moving the game off of PlayAuditorium.com, and to make the standalone version slightly better, we’re storing all the save information locally on the user’s machine. This includes the web version! In order to cut down on server fees we will no longer be maintaining the PlayAuditorium database, so the local save means your progress will only be saved on the machine you play on.

**So, what else have you been up to? Anything new? How’s your mum?**

If you’ve been following any Cipher Prime news, you’ll know we’ve been working on a [neat little puzzler called Splice](http://www.cipherprime.com/2012/01/philadelphia-inquirer-features-splice/). Well, we’re putting the finishing touches on that game and you’ll hear more about it the near future!

And expect to hear from us soon about a KickStarter campaign we’re getting set to launch. Something to do with a sequel…a bigger, better, multiplayer one!

She’s doing well, thanks for asking!
