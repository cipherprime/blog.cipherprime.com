[![](/img/blog/fractaltitle.png "Fractal Title Screen")](/img/blog/fractaltitle.png)You may have noticed we haven’t had a lot of posts recently. We have a whole ton of great news regarding Auditorium that we’ll be able to discuss soon. Also, we’d gone into hiding so we could wrap up our latest title, Fractal. We’re not totally finished, but we were able to get a pretty amazing, workable version entered into this years [IGF](http://www.igf.com/ "IGF")! We have our fingers crossed and hope she can keep up with all the _[RIDICULOUSLY CREATIVE ENTRIES](http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entries2010.php "IGF Entries")_.

We were at the [GXL Unleashed](http://thegxl.com/ "The GXL") event this weekend and were able to show off Fractal and the response was great. Not only did we see a lot of people playing an arcade game for hours at a time, we were also able to make some really crucial game changes based on the feedback. Thank you so much GXL for having us at the event. We can’t wait for next years big LAN!

Stay tuned — we’ll be throwing up more info concerning Auditorium and Fractal soon. The next couple of weeks should be very interesting indeed!
