What’s a game jam?
------------------

A game jam is a contest in which people try to create a game in a limited period of time. Once a month, Cipher Prime hosts game jams–we choose a theme, and then challenge [Dev Night](http://www.cipherprime.com/devnight "Come!") attendees to make a game based off of that theme. Everyone votes for their favorite project at the next Dev Night, and the winner takes home a sick-nasty prize!

The rules
---------

We’re bending our typical game jam rules for this week’s throw-down:

*   Participants have an entire week to work on their games (starting from 5:00 PM on Thursday, May 2nd)
*   Participants can work on their games from wherever they like
*   Games are due by the beginning of our next Dev Night (5:00 PM on Thursday, May 9th)
*   If you want to participate, let the [Dev Night Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/philly-dev-night) know!

What’s the theme?
-----------------

This month’s theme is “Options.” Use it as you will. You could make a game about moral choices, or a game about in-game options menus. Get creative, and start creating!
