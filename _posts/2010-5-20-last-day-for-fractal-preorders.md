We are really excited to announce that today is the last day of preorders. At midnight EST tonight we will be shutting down the preorder system. Until then, preorder for $9.99 and receive a 33% savings off our launch price. Head on over to the store and [preorder now](https://store.cipherprime.com/promo/fractal)!

This is also very exciting, because it means the launch is right around the corner! Keep your eyes peeled for news on the upcoming release. More news VERY SOON!

We have also launched a new unified mailing list system today. This means youâ€™ll no longer have to worry about receiving multiple emails. You can easily unsubscribe or subscribe at any of our gaming sites.

Also, we would like to offer a big THANK YOU to everyone who has helped spread the word about Fractal. Keep it up!
