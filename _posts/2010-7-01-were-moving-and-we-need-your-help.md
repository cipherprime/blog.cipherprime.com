For those of you who have come to see us at our old office, things are changing! As of this week, we’ve moved into our new space right on 3rd and Chestnut Street! We are overwhelmingly excited. Not only is the space 5 times larger, it’s an awesome location with great food at almost exactly the cost we were paying before. For us, this is just our dream come true. It actually feels like we’re turning into a real company =)

Unfortunately, moving takes a lot of time and money. **Which means, we’re going to have a moving sale!** So, what is the moving sale? Both Auditorium and Fractal will be offered at $4.99 each. We’ll be giving you Iterate ( the theme to Fractal ) with any Fractal purchase and we’ll be giving you Autumn ( the 1st Auditorium single) with any copy of Auditorium.

[![Accepting Donations Soon](/img/blog/the-poor-child.jpg "Accepting Donations Soon")](/img/blog/the-poor-child.jpg)**On top of that, we’re going to be opening up donations for the duration of the sale.** This is rather huge for us and something we haven’t done since we created the demo of Auditorium. Dain and I are currently trying to figure out what we can give to anyone who donates, but rest assured we’ll figure something out. **This is a really tricky time for us right now and we sincerely need your help.** I promise no donation will go unnoticed. If anyone has any ideas for what we could give away for donations just let us know!

If all goes as planned it looks like the sale will start mid-next week! For anyone who is local, you know we have a few t-shirts laying around. We’ll be working on getting those online soon as well!
