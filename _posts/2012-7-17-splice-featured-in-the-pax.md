[Splice](http://cipherprime.com/games/splice/) made the [PAX 10](http://prime.paxsite.com/pax10#splice) selection! Turns out we’ll be at PAX Prime this year after all! This is a huge accomplishment for us, and we couldn’t be happier and more grateful for the opportunity to stand alongside some of the great indie developers of today. If you’re going to be at PAX Prime, be sure to come by and visit us at our booth. We’ll be giving away tons of swag! Plus, you’ll have a chance to play our games and talk with the developers.

As you may well know, the Steam Summer Sale is currently in full swing. As part of the sale, all Cipher Prime games are 50% off through July 23rd. These include [Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/), the [Splice Soundtrack DLC](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209801/), the [Splice Soundtrack Edition](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/14996/) bundle, [Fractal : Make Blooms Not War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61310/), and [Auditorium](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205870/). For the duration of the sale, we’ve also dropped the price of the [Flight of Angels album](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/flight-of-angels-splice-ost) on Bandcamp.

Get ‘em while they’re hot!
