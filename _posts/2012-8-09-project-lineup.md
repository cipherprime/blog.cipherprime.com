**Quick Shout-Out: [Dev Night](http://www.cipherprime.com/2012/08/upcoming-dev-nights/) is tonight from 5pm to 1am. Bring a laptop with [Unity](http://unity3d.com/unity/download/) installed. Have [Sculptris](http://www.pixologic.com/sculptris/) installed too if you’re participating in the artist initiative.**

So what’s next at Cipher Prime? We have a few projects on hand actually. While Dain and Andrei are in the process of wrapping up the iPad version of _[Splice](http://cipherprime.com/games/splice/)_, Will and myself have been working on two other side projects as we gear up for _[Auditorium 2: Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)_.

The project I’m working on right now is really a way to help familiarize myself with the Unity developer environment, as well as the studio’s production pipeline. It’s a game called _Feedback_.

We have another project planned that will actually lead into development on _[Auditorium 2 : Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)_. It’s a multi-player, arcade-style shooter that we’re currently calling _Intake_. The project will last exactly four weeks, and will help us establish development roles for each team member while building out the framework for _[Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)_. _Intake_ should serve as a pretty good test run of our new production pipeline as well as the framework. What we learn with _Intake_ will go a long way in helping us with production on _[Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)_.

Among the features we’re testing include multi-player mode and matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, cross platform support, and cloud saving. [_Splice_](http://cipherprime.com/games/splice/) supports some of these features, but much of it was implemented late in the dev cycle, leading to a number of setbacks. Having the architecture for it from square one with _[Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet) _will give us more time for creative development.

If we are able to pull together a polished game in just four weeks time, _Intake_ will be released through the Cipher Prime Store. If not, well, it’ll get placed on the back burner for a while, but we will have learned some valuable lessons from the effort. Our focus from there will be to get the level editor built for _[Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)._

This road to _[Duet](http://cpri.me/A2Duet)_ is an eventful and exciting one for sure!
