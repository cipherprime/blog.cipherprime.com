By popular demand, we’ve extended the [Fractal](http://www.playfractal.com) Preorder deadline to **May 24th, 2010!**

Why May 24th? Umm, well you see, the thing is…

### **OFFICIAL FRACTAL RELEASE DATE: MAY 24th, 2010**

On Monday, we’ll flip the switch! Everyone who has preordered will be able to download their games; everyone who hasn’t will have to pay full price! [Don’t miss your chance to save!](https://store.cipherprime.com/promo/fractal)
