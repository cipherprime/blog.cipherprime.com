Remember our [silly little mini-game](http://blog.cipherprime.com/games/mini-games/2015/03/monster-want-burger/), [Monster Want Burger](http://monsterwantburger.com)? Well, we’re happy to announce it’s now available on iPhone and iPad!

[![Monster Want Burger! 720p](/img/blog/Monster-Want-Burger-720p.png)](/img/blog/Monster-Want-Burger-720p.png)

![IMG_1986](/img/blog/IMG_1986.png)Not only that, **we’re featured in “Best New Games!”** At its core, Monster Want Burger is an extremely cute game where you make burgers for a hungry monster. We’ve added a lot of cool little features, including a custom burger naming algorithm. But probably the most important thing is how many “firsts” we had with this game. Monster Want Burger is:

*   Our first self-published iPhone game!
*   Our first game aimed towards kids!
*   Our first game with a character!
*   The first time we made all our assets inside of Unity3D (using some cool new tools we’ve been working on…)
*   The first time we’ve released a game made for a [Dev Night Game Jam](http://phillydevnight.com)
*   The first time we self-published a desktop game as pay-what-you-want through our own distribution method
*   And last but not least, Cipher Prime’s first released mini-game!

Thanks for being with us for so many first time events.
