**INCREDIBLE NEWS!!! We are ecstatic to announce that BOTH Auditorium and Fractal have been chosen as finalists in the [2010 IndieCade festival](http://www.indiecade.com)!**

[![](/img/blog/logo_menu_indiecade.png "logo_menu_indiecade")](../wp-content/uploads/2010/09/logo_menu_indiecade.png)For those of you who don’t know, IndieCade is an annual event in Culver City, CA that features all different types of independent games from every genre and for every platform imaginable. It’s a three day festival-conference hybrid that gives the indie game community the opportunity to share knowledge and ideas while celebrating independent developers from all over the globe.

Needless to say, we feel very honored to receive such recognition and are incredibly excited to be attending the event in October.

We could never have achieved this without the loyal support of our fans, friends and followers. Thank you all so much for helping us reach such heights!

Keep an eye out for pictures and news from the IndieCade conference in a few weeks!
