You spoke and we listened. We carefully read through your customer reviews both on the iTunes Store and on our blog. It looks like many of you have been experience crashing and problems with OpenFeint on older firmware, so we’ve fixed up a few bugs and temporarily taken out OpenFeint support until it is thoroughly stable. Also, a big shout-out to RubyX, who pointed out some problems we were having with localization! We’ve fixed those issues, so now you can enjoy Fractal in German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. We really appreciate everyone’s patience with us and for keeping us in the know! The new update has been submitted to Apple, so as soon as it is approved we’ll let you guys know!

On a lighter note, the new version of Pulse will be submitted some time next week. Between judging for [IndieCade](http://www.indiecade.com) and finishing up Fractal, the Pulse update fell by the wayside a bit — but don’t fret! Pulse v1.2 will have new tracks, a new difficulty ranking system, clearer scoring, timing fixes, and all around better performance.  We’ve personally been playing the new levels and we’re having a lot of fun — we really think you’re going to be pleased with the new levels and features!

Lastly, as some of you know, we’re a small, dedicated team.  Your support and feedback helps us thrive and grow, and your feedback helps make our games better.  We simply wouldn’t be who we are without **you**.  We simply can’t state it enough, thank you for continually supporting and communicating with us! Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for any reason, and keep sending in bug reports! Thanks to super-fans like RubyX and Dan Nye (who singlehandedly found like 20 bugs in Pulse!), we’re able to keep giving you the best experiences we can muster. So in addition to our blog, keep in touch with us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cipherprime), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cipherprime), or our mailing list.  And remember, updates coming soon… very soon.
