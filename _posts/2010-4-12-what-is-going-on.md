So, we have been INCREDIBLY busy. Let me tell you a little about what we’ve been doing.

I had the pleasure of speaking at the [Flash Gaming Summit](http://www.flashgamingsummit.com/ "Flash Gaming Summit") about “**Monetizing Your Game Outside of Sponsorship**” with _Colin Northway_([Fantastic Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/ "Fantastic Contraption")), _Daniel James_([Three Rings](http://www.threerings.net/ "Three Rings")), _Sian Yue Tan_ ([Rocketbirds](http://www.rocketbirds.com/ "Rocket Birds Revolution")) and Moderated by _Andy Moore_([Steambirds](http://armorgames.com/play/5426/steambirds "SteamBirds")).  I think the panel went well and you can always watch it online at the [Flash Gaming Summit Site](http://www.flashgamingsummit.com/ "Flash Gaming Summit") and let me know what you thought. I really enjoyed having the opportunity to hang out and relax with everyone from the panel. Overall the FGS was a great experience and a MASSIVE upgrade from last years event.

After the FGS we quickly went right to the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/ "Game Developers Conference"). One talk in particular by _Kellee Santiago_ and _Robin Huncki_ ([thatgamecompany](http://thatgamecompany.com/ "That Game Company")) called “**How to Manage an Exploratory Development Process**“, ignited a fire here in our tiny office. We spent the remainder of March refining what we were doing and how we could do it all faster and with less frustration. Making original games is a ton of hard work and requires a lot of positive energy. We also talked at length about _Nick Waanders_ and _Kees Rijnen_ ([Slick Entertainment](http://www.slickentertainment.com/ "Slick Entertainment")) session called “**SCRAP METAL: Pushing the Envelope with a Team of Two.**” Learning more about their process helped us identify a few things we have been doing right and just didn’t even know it. All of this learning has played a major role in the development of our new title [Fractal](http://www.playfractal.com "Fractal"). Overall the GDC was well worth it and has helped us a lot. We also had the pleasure of meeting so many fantastic ladies and gents.

Right now, we are in the final stages of testing with Fractal. As long as everything goes as planned we will be releasing in just a few weeks. **Tentatively, we’re setting our release around the beginning of May.**

The [Indie Love Bundle](http://indielovebundle.com "The Indie Love Bundle") was a huge success and it looks like we’ll be unifying our whole purchasing system to work on the framework we built for the sale. I have been actively communicating with a few other Indie Developers and **it looks like we’ll be able to throw up a new bundle not very long after the Fractal Launch.** Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’ll have any titles in that bundle, but it will be a great value all the same.

I apologize to everyone for the lack of updates on our side. Everything has been CRAZY and we’ve been feeling very overwhelmed and just haven’t had the time to keep everyone in the loop. We’re going to start making a much more active effort in that regard. If you feel like we’re not staying on top of things make sure you drop us a comment and let us know!
