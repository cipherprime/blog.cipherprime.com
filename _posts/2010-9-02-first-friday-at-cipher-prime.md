Last month, in true Old City spirit, the guys at [Drink Philly](http://www.drinkphilly.com) (our neighbors across the hall) hosted an open house for “First Friday”. The event was a huge success and we’ve got some great news!

They’ll be doing it all over again tomorrow night! **But this time, Cipher Prime is getting in on the action!** Here at the studio, we will be showing off both Fractal and Auditorium as well as featuring the work of local artists [Alex Hohlov](http://www.alexhohlov.com/ "Alex Holuv") and [Rachel Kantor](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rachelkantor/).
