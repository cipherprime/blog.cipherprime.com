Alright, so first off, happy holidays to every denomination! Things have been a bit sparse around here as we’ve taken time off to visit family and such, but I wanted to give you guys a quick update. Progress on the game is moving forward, as we build out the community site as well as the new levels and audio. We’ve put as many hours as possible into the game for a 2008 release, but year-end business often gets in the way of, well, doing business. We are very confident for a January 2009 release, and should hopefully be able to give you guys an exact release date in the next two weeks. Thanks for staying tuned, and have a great New Year!

P.S. Speaking of holidays, we’ve been getting emails from people who have donated but not received their gift. This is an automated process, so we’re looking into the issue and should have some answers for you soon. Thanks again!
