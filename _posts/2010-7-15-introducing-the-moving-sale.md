As some of you know, we’ve been trying to move for a long time. Our old office had no AC, no heat, lots of bugs, and was generally just too small. Goodbye 160 sq ft; Hello 1000sq ft!!

Not only is this upgrade amazing, the rent is just about the same. However, moving always costs a lot of money and we really want to hire on another employee. **So, the answer is clear… WE MUST FUNDRAISER!**

In the old days, we took donations for Auditorium and were able to stay true with our promises and make it into a fully developed title. Now, it’s on the web, iPhone, iPad, and coming soon to the PS3, XBox360, and PSP! **This time, we’ll be offering both** [**Auditorium**](http://www.playauditorium.com "Auditorium: The Online Experience") **and** [**Fractal**](http://www.playfractal.com "Fractal - Challenge Yourself") **for 50% off, lowering both titles to $4.99 for two weeks. This special moving sale promo will end on July 30th, so act fast!** You will also receive a free audio track with either purchase during the sale. With Auditorium comes Autumn, our first single. Fractal comes with Iterate!, Fractal’s theme song.

Now, we must ask you all for your support (trust me, it means a lot). Here are some of the great ways you can help us keep making amazing titles.

1.  _Tell your friends and family we exist! Get them to play Fractal or Auditorium, tell them we’re a small team. Pass on our great luck story._
2.  _Write to your favorite magazine, forum, or gaming site and tell them you’d like to see some info on our games. Press is so hard for us and we really rely heavily on word of mouth. So, if you can… put in a good word!_
3.  _Grab a copy of Fractal or Auditorium for 50% before the sale ends on July 30th._
4.  _Grab an Audio track for $0.99 if you already own Fractal or Auditorium. [Get Autumn (Auditorium).](https://store.cipherprime.com/purchase/16 "Autumn - Our First Auditorium Single") [Get Iterate! (Fractal).](https://store.cipherprime.com/purchase/15 "Iterate! The Fractal Theme")_
5.  _Write us! Tell us who you are, what you liked, what you hated. We want to get to know you. You’re here, so you mean a lot to us already._
6.  _Subscribe to our_ [_Mailing List_](http://www.cipherprime.com#mailing_list "Join the Mailing List")_,_ [_RSS Feed_](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CipherPrimeBlog)_, or follow us on_ [_Twitter_](http://twitter.com/cipherprime) _so you can know when our new titles start coming out.

7.  _Beyond anything else, enjoy!_
