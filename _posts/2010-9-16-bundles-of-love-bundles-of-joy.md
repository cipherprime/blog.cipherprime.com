We’ve put together a brand new [Indie Bundle](http://www.theindiebundle.com) with our friends at [Dejobaan Games](http://dejobaan.com/), [Digital Eel](http://www.digital-eel.com/), [Farbs](http://www.farbs.org/), [Lazy 8 Studios](http://www.lazy8studios), [Llamasoft](http://www.llamasoft.co.uk/frontpage.php), and [Nifflas’ Games](http://nifflas.ni2.se/)!

The bundle features [AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!: A Reckless Disregard for Gravity](http://dejobaan.com/aaaaa/), [BrainPipe](http://www.shrapnelgames.com/Digital_Eel/BP/BP_page.html), [Captain Forever](http://www.captainforever.com), [Cogs](http://www.cogsgame.com), [Saira](http://nifflas.ni2.se/?page=Saira), and [Space Giraffe](http://www.llamasoft.co.uk/frontpage.php) (valued at nearly $80). Lucky for you, we’re selling the bundle for a mere $19.99!

We're passing the savings on to YOUUUUUU!

We highly recommend you hop on over to [http://www.theindiebundle.com](http://www.theindiebundle.com/) and snag a copy before it’s too late!

But wait, there’s still more good news! If you didn’t get to chance to pick up the last Indie Bundle, it’s still available on the Indie Bundle Site!

And if you’re REALLY itching to get your game on, you can grab the Mega-Love Bundle which includes both the Summer-of-Love Bundle and the original Indie Love Bundle — over $160 worth of games — for the ludicrously low price of $29.99.  Now that’s a bargain, ain’t it?

As with all games at the [CP Store](https://store.cipherprime.com), you can access and download your games at any time — no DRM, no middlemen. And if you already own games in the bundle, you can send your extra copies to your friends, so they can enjoy them too!

The sale ends Thursday Wednesday, Sept. 22nd, at 11:59 PM, so act fast and [pick one up today](http://www.theindiebundle.com)!
