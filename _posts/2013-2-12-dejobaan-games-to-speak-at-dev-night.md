We’re excited to announce that Ichiro Lambe and Rohit Shenoy, the esteemed ballers of fellow indie developer [Dejobaan Games](http://www.dejobaan.com/ "Dejobaan Games"), will be doing a virtual Q&A session at our February 28th Game Dev night. Their studio touts such charming titles as [_Drunken Robot Pornography_](http://www.dejobaan.com/drunken/ "Drunken Robot Pornography") and _[Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby](http://www.dejobaan.com/kickit/ "Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby")._

Due to our mad fan love for this studio, we’re partnering up for some promotions: the members of Dejobaan’s mailing list just received a discount on [_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice "Splice"), and we will be offering Dejobaan’s games on [our mailing list](http://www.cipherprime.com/mailinglist "our mailing list"). We hope that these promotions will be the first of many partnerships to come!
