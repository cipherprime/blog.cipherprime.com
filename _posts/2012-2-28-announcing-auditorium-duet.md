We’ve been dropping hints like breadcrumbs for weeks, and it’s time to let these doves loose: Its an Auditorium smörgåsbord, and everyone gets seconds. **One-two punch activate!**

SUCKER PUNCH!

### Auditorium is now on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205870/)!

Our first game, the one that started our whole crazy game-making careers, is finally available as a PC/Mac downloadable title!

![Auditorium Standalone Graphic](/img/blog/auditorium_blogpost_sqr_logosOnly.png "Auditorium Standalone Graphic")As we’ve mentioned in previous emails, prior purchasers will have the option of receiving a free Steam Key to unlock the game through the Steam system, downloading the game from the Cipher Prime Store, or continue playing it through the web interface on the Auditorium Game page. Like with [Fractal](http://www.cipherprime.com/2011/12/steam-codes-for-fractal-owners/), we’re still working out details with Steam, but barring catastrophes we expect you guys to be able to get your hands on some CD-Keys in the next week or so. We’re also going to be changing up our sites in the coming months, so keep posted for news!

_**Important Update!**__Steam keys are now available for all previous owners of Auditorium: The Online Experience! Just follow these instructions to redeem:_

1.  _Log into your account at the [Cipher Prime Store](https://store.cipherprime.com/)._
2.  _If you haven’t already, **Activate Your Copy** of _Auditorium_._
3.  _In the product list, under Auditorium: The Online Experience, click **Generate Serial**._
4.  _Launch Steam and log into your Steam account._
5.  _Click the **Games Menu**._
6.  _Choose **Activate a Product on Steam…**_
7.  _Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the process._

_If you don’t have a CP Store account, please log in with your username at [www.playauditorium.com](http://www.playauditorium.com); you’ll be given instructions on how to create a CP Store account._

Now the big one.

CROSS-COUNTER!

### We’ve launched a Kickstarter for _[Auditorium 2: Duet](http://www.cipherprime.com/kickstarter)!_

[![](/img/blog/kickstater_page_logo.png "kickstater_page_logo")](/img/blog/kickstater_page_logo.png)

The [official Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet) is live, so go on and check it out! For those of you unfamiliar with Kickstarter, it’s a fundraising website where creators can pitch their project ideas to the public and offer special rewards as a ‘thank you’ to backers who help fund the development of those ideas. Kickstarter has more thorough explanations over on [their FAQ](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter%20basics#HowItWork) page, and some examples of [other awesome projects](http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/most-funded) as well.

Auditorium Duet will have its roots in Auditorium, but it’s going to be bigger, better, and — most importantly — it’s going to be _multiplayer!_ The initial release is planned as a PC/Mac standalone, but we will be considering cross-platform support from the beginning; we’re just waiting to gauge interest and determine hardware requirements.

Please pledge what you can for the Kickstarter and we promise we will put our hearts into making this game! Without this funding, we won’t be able to afford making it, which will totally bum us out. Be sure to leave comments, and as always we are open to feedback! We’ll be posting frequent Kickstarter updates on our blog (not the mailing list), so check back frequently for the latest info. Thank you all for your support!

So how can you help out at this stage? Talk to us! Ask us questions! Email us, reach out to us on Twitter, post on our blog, just let us know what you think about Auditorium 2! And be sure to tell all your friends — we need all the help we can get!
