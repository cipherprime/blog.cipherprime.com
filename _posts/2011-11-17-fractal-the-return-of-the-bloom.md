As always, when Cipher Prime goes radio silent, it’s usually because we’re working on something _awesome_.

Or playing Starcraft II in a rum-and-whiskey fueled haze. Which, to be fair, is _also __awesome_.

First, we deal with the rumours. Yes, we are working on a [new title](http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=579)! No, I’m not telling you anything about it yet. Yes, Pulse is getting new tracks! No, you can’t hear them yet.

What I can tell you is that [Fractal](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/fractal), in all its Unity-powered-3d-accelerated glory, is coming to your Mac via the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fractal-make-blooms-not-war/id479566380?mt=12) and the [Cipher Prime Store](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal) **right the #$%! now** for **$6.99**. As always, if you purchase directly from us, we get 100% of the proceeds!

So much has changed since Fractal originally came out I don’t even know where to begin. We’ve rebalanced Campaign mode so that you can **start from any level**. We rebalanced Arcade mode so that it’s **fun and challenging**. We’ve updated our graphics and smoothed out the engine so the game runs, **crisp, clean, and beautiful** — even at full-screen, 1680×1050. New drum loops, crisper strings, cleaner sounds — this Fractal is the real deal.

Now [as we said before](http://www.cipherprime.com/2011/02/the-road-ahead/), if you already own Fractal, you will get this desktop upgrade totally _gratis_. Just log into your account at [store.cipherprime.com](https://store.cipherprime.com) and get to downloading! You can also get [Iterate!](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/iterate-theme-from-fractal), the official theme from Fractal, from our [music page](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/), for 99 cents; this also includes the contemplative reprise that appears in the menu screens.

As for Steam? It’s coming, I promise. No seriously. We are _this_ close.
