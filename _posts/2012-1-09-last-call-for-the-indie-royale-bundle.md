[![New Year Indie Royale Bundle](/img/blog/newyearsindieroyalebundle.jpg "New Year Indie Royale Bundle")](http://www.indieroyale.com/)

[Fractal](cipherprime.com/games/fractal) is included in Indie Royale’s [New Year’s Bundle](http://www.indieroyale.com/), but it’s the last day of the sale!

For the next 24 hours, you can purchase Fractal along with three other games: [Nuclear Dawn](http://www.nucleardawnthegame.com/) (InterWave Studios), [Max and the Magic Marker](http://maxandthemagicmarker.com/) (Press Play), and [Super Crossfire](http://radiangames.com/?page_id=623) (Radian Games).

The Indie Royale Bundle is a fluctuating minimum price bundle, meaning that the minimum price goes up the more people that buy it! And if people pay more than the minimum price, it reduces the price for other buyers! (Also, you get a copy of [George & Jonathan](http://georgeandjonathan.com/)‘s “Beautiful Lifestyle” chiptune album!)

So grab the bundle at [Indie Royale](http://www.indieroyale.com/), or at least go to check out the action!
