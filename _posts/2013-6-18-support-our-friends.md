This week, we’re giving shout-outs to two awesome Cipher Prime friends whom you should totally support,  [Phil Kahn](http://philkahn.com/) and [Greg Lobanov](http://dumbandfat.com/).

Phil Kahn: Webcomic Writer
--------------------------

Friend of the studio Phil Kahn co-writes fantasy webcomic [Guilded Age](http://guildedage.net/), which is regularly featured on Joystiq’s “Sunday Morning Funnies.” Yesterday, Phil and gang launched a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/philkahn/guilded-age-vol-2-and-animated-shorts) to back Guilded Age Volume 2 and Guilded Age animated shorts. So check out the comic, and if you can, help creative people create stuff.

Greg Lobanov: Game Developer
----------------------------

Regular [dev nighter](http://www.cipherprime.com/devnight) Greg Lobanov just got back from featuring his game, _[Perfection](http://perfectiongame.net/)_, at IndieCade at E3. Perfection is a surprisingly soothing puzzle game about cutting shapes to fit into outlines. It’s available for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. Here’s [Greg demoing the game for Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/perfection-is-the-calmest-i-ve-been-while-cutting-things-256179.phtml):
