[![](/img/blog/cover.png "cover")](http://soundcloud.com/dainsaint/say-saint-remix)Hey guys! I’ve just put an entry into [Olivia Broadfield](http://oliviabroadfield.com/)/[TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com)‘s [“Say” remix competition](http://www.propellerheads.se/news/htmlmail/111223-olivia.html)! As some of you know, I’m a huge fan of [Propellerhead](http://www.propellerheads.se/)‘s [Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) software, and while Reason 5 has been pretty great to me, after using the trial of Reason 6 to do this competition I’m simply not going back. Being able to have live audio go directly into Reason is amazing enough, but the changes to the work flow are also stunning — this remix took me less than 6 hours!

The great thing about this competition is that the winner gets a free, fully licensed copy of Reason 6, as well as a [Balance](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/balance/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&article=features) input/mixing board, which would be a welcome replacement for my busted [MobilePre](http://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-MobilePre-Mobile-Preamp-Interface/dp/B0000TP57E) (which I’ve dropped one too many times, methinks).

So if you’ve got a SoundCloud account, [head over to the track and leave a comment](http://soundcloud.com/dainsaint/say-saint-remix)! There are over 425 entries in the competition, so anything you can do to help me stand out will be awesome. And if you don’t have a SoundCloud account, head over and [give it a listen anyway](http://soundcloud.com/dainsaint/say-saint-remix)! I hope you like it!
