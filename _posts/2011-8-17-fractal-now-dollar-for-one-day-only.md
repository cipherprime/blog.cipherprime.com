Things are really starting to come together at Cipher Prime.

Thanks to you, we’ve got one of the [top 10 music games on the iPad](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/pulse). We’ve got a great new work schedule that’s keeping us fed, rested, and sane. I think I actually saw Will eat a vegetable the other day. And to top it off? Fractal for iPad is done.

### **That’s right. _Fractal : Make Blooms Not War_ hits iTunes tomorrow, Thursday, August 18th!**

[![](/img/blog/1splash.png "1splash")](/img/blog/1splash-e1313419195306.png)So here’s the deal. On Thursday morning, we’re moving the official Fractal website from [www.playfractal.com](http://www.playfractal.com) to its new home here at cipherprime.com. When we do that, you won’t be able to purchase the legacy desktop version anymore. Why? Well, as [previously mentioned](http://www.cipherprime.com/2011/02/the-road-ahead/), we’re taking all of the enhancements we gained by porting Fractal to Unity and taking it straight to the desktop. Also, as previously mentioned, if you already own the legacy desktop version of Fractal, you will get upgraded to the new version absolutely free.

Here’s the fun bit. We’ve been so stoked about this re-release, we figured it’s time invite more people to the Fractal family. And that means it’s sale time.

### **[From now until Thursday morning, you’ll be able to purchase the legacy version of Fractal for only $0.99.](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal)**

And yes. If you purchase Fractal during the sale, _you will get the upgraded PC/Mac version when it is released — **free**_. Think of it as a pre-pre-order. [So head on over to the store](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal)! I guarantee — you won’t be disappointed.

P.S. Oh yeah. Fractal is coming to Steam. I don’t think we mentioned that before.
