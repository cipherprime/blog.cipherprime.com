So what happens when 6 great indie game developers come together in the month of love? Well, there really is only one option… **The Indie Love Bundle**. Inspired by nothing short of pure happiness, we have teamed up with [Amanita Design](http://www.amanita-design.net/ "Amanita Design"), [Broken Rules](http://brokenrul.es/ "Broken Rules"), [Citeremis](http://www.citeremis.com/ "Citeremis"), [Hemisphere Games](http://www.hemispheregames.com/ "Hemisphere Games"), and [Omni Systems](http://www.omni-labs.com/ "Omni Systems") to bring you a great gaming bundle.

From now until **Friday the 19th at 11:59PM EST** you can go grab _[And Yet it Moves](http://www.andyetitmoves.net/ "And Yet It Moves")_, _[Auditorium](http://www.playauditorium.com/ "Auditorium")_, _[Aztaka](http://www.aztaka.com "Aztaka")_, _[Eufloria](http://www.eufloria-game.com/ "Eufloria")_, _[Machinarium](http://machinarium.net/demo/ "Machinarium")_, and _[Osmos](http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/ "Osmos")_ from [www.theindiebundle.com](http://www.theindiebundle.com "The Indie Love Bundle") for the amazingly low price of $20.00 USD. That’s an $85 dollar value at a fraction of the cost!

What’s more exciting than this bundle? The fact that this is one of the first times a group of Indie Game developers have come together offering a game bundle to the world without any big distributor in the way. _Not only is the bundle cheap, all your hard earned cash goes directly to the developers_. This really is a bundle of love.

Enjoy and [don’t forget the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/v/XPOykWeqHgY&hl=en_US&fs=1&autoplay=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=0&rel=0 "The Indie Love Bundle Trailer")!
