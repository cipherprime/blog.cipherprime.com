This February, Cipher Prime had the honor of being featured in [IndieCade East 2013](http://www.indiecade.com/2013/east_info/ "IndieCade!")! For one orgasmic weekend of indie love, we shipped off to New York City’s [Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.movingimage.us/) to share our games with developers, artists, press, and fellow game enthusiasts alike.

We demoed [_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice) and gave a show-and-tell session about its production. We also participated in the GameSlam, a three-minute pitch-your-game throw-down with other developers, where we showed off a prototype called _Intake_.

We played and were inspired by other featured games, including the gorgeous four-paneled puzzler _[Gorogoa](http://www.gorogoa.com/ "The most beautiful game ever")_ and the face-meltingly competitive _[Hokra](http://www.ramirocorbetta.com/hokra/ "Hokra")_. Our favorite gaming experience, though, was helping an auditorium of people collectively guide a spaceship to safety using laser pointers in _[Renga](http://wallfour.co.uk/announce/renga/ "Renga")_.

We also explored the museum’s “Spacewar! Video Games Blast Off” exhibition, which explored the evolution of videogames from the first digital video game, _Spacewar!_. We had the most fun shooting life-sized portals onto a massive wall projection of _Portal_.

IndieCade was exhilarating, and we feel privileged to have been a part of it. We can’t wait until next year!
