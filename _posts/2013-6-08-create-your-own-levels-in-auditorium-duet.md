When we were making [_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice), we created an in-game level editor for ourselves so we could jump into any level and modify it while playing. The editor was a simple drag-and-drop interface for creating and deleting nodes, and it was super streamlined and convenient. We were sad that our players never got to use it. We’re hoping _Duet_ will be a different story.

We’ve created a similar level editing system for _Duet_, both to simplify our own level-making process, and to allow players to create their own levels. The in-game editor allows you to drag-and-drop streams, controls, and obstacles into the level, or modify and destroy any of these elements at will. _Auditorium: Duet_ will be a creative exercise both for us as developers, and for players, too.

Here’s a sneak peak at the level editor:
