We are proud to say [we were featured](http://www.thefwa.com/?app=winners&id=6859 "Auditorium FWA Site of the Day Award") on the [FWA](http://www.theFWA.com "Featured Website Awards") today as ‘Site of the Day.’ For us, this is a big honor. The FWA showcases sites that go above and beyond, totally pushing the envelope for what is cutting edge on the internet today.

Meanwhile, we have also won a few other awards. Our favorite award was a listing on [Moluv](http://www.Moluv.com "Moluv.com"). Not only is Moluv an awesome site, Maurice (site owner) is just a stand-up gentlemen. Maurice, you’re amazing and thank you so much! Besides giving us a featured site award for both [Cipher Prime](http://www.cipherprime.com "Cipher Prime") and [Auditorum](http://www.playAuditorium.com "Auditorium | Game"), Maurice has also added us on his site as a friend and even donated to our cause. Please check out his site. He has shown us a lot of love and we are very grateful. Keep up the good work man!

On top of these awards we also won a [Dope Award](http://www.dopeawards.com/?winner=1402 "Auditorium Dope Award") and ‘[Site of the Day](http://www.e-creative.net/web_sites.asp?ID=11983 "E-Creative Site of The Day Award")‘ over at E-Creative. We are very thankful and hope we have some more award announcements soon!
