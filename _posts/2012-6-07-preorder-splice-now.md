Splice is the newest Cipher Prime title! It’s a game of exploration and experimentation where you solve puzzles by arranging cells into certain shapes. Your task is to discover how different cells react to each other as you move them around. It’s quite a challenge and we promise that you probably haven’t played anything quite like it!

We’re also really happy to say that Splice was the winner of [Intel’s 2011 Level Up contest](http://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/levelup2011/) in the Best Puzzle Game category! We’re also really proud of our baby for being our best looking game yet.![Splice_Intel_Level_Up_2011](/img/blog/560451_10151179543688858_1609786624_n.jpg "Splice_Intel_Level_Up_2011")

For the current release Splice is available on Steam for PC and Mac. [If you pre-order you’ll get the game and a copy of the soundtrack for free!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/) The soundtrack has seven songs, one from each of the first seven sequences in the game. A PC [demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/) is also available on Steam (we’re working with Steam to put up the Mac demo).

**Auditorium Duet Update**

Now that Splice development is winding down, we’re almost ready to swing full gear into [Duet](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet). We know we’ve been a little quiet on the update front, and we’re sorry for that, but you’ll be hearing more from us soon about Duet.

We’re going to start by getting all the Kickstarter backer prizes squared away, and then we’ll have some technology updates through our Dev Notes. We’ve got a handful of new interns ready to help out, and we’re excited about our next steps as a company, and with Duet’s potential for showing off our studio’s progress!

As we’ve mentioned before, we expect Duet to take anywhere from six months to a year of development time once we get underway, even with our crew of four (plus interns). A lot of the big uncertainties dev-wise will be the multiplayer and music generation aspects of the game, which we want to get just right!

So stay tuned, and in the meantime be sure to [check out Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/)!
