[![Pulse: IGM 2011 Game of the Year Nominee](/img/blog/igm_game_of_the_year.png "Pulse: IGM 2011 Game of the Year Nominee")](http://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-awards-2011-vote/)Cipher Prime wants to thank its fans for driving the success of [Pulse: Volume One](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/pulse/) these past six months. We were ecstatic when Pulse was chosen as Apple’s iPad [Game of the Week](http://www.diygamer.com/2011/05/cipher-primes-pulse-set-huge-waves-ipad-5/), and then we were humbled by the breadth of your support. You’ve helped us incredibly through your emails, your comments, your buzz, and your awesome reviews. It’s because of you that Pulse still tops the iTunes Music Games Chart! People keep [saying](http://www.theipadfan.com/pulse-volume-update-showcases-songs-social-features/) [cool](http://www.gadgetmech.com/8-best-music-apps-for-ipad/) [things](http://www.hitphone.fr/pulse-volume-one-art-2969-1.html) [about](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Pulse%3A+Volume+One/news.asp?c=33661) [us](http://www.allaboutthegames.co.uk/feature_story.php?headline=Pulse--Volume-1-hits-the-app-store--Stylish-rhythm-action-gets-your-blood-pumping-News&article_id=11840), and we’re stoked!

This past June, the [Indie Game Magazine](http://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-awards-2011-vote/) (IGM) put [Pulse on their cover](http://www.indiegamemag.com/issue16/) and devoted seven pages to Mike and Zak’s interview with the Cipher Prime team in our Philly studio. Now we’ve been nominated for IGM’s [2011 Indie Game of the Year Awards](http://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-awards-2011-vote/) in the Game of the Year, Best Mobile Game, Best Sound/Music, and Best Graphics categories. Readers vote for the winners, and our competition is stiff–we’re up against awesome games like [Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/) and [Frozen Synapse](http://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-awards-2011-vote/). So we need our fans to head over to the IGM site and [vote Pulse: Volume One to the top](http://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-awards-2011-vote/) in all four categories!

And while you’re there, be sure to check out IGM. They put out print and digital issues featuring game reviews and absolutely fantastic interviews. In recent issues the’ve picked the brains of [Final Form Games](http://www.finalformgames.com/) ([Jamestown](http://finalformgames.com/jamestown/)) and [Frictional Games](http://www.frictionalgames.com/site/) ([Amnesia: The Dark Descent](http://www.amnesiagame.com/#main)). We love the IGM guys and had a great time hosting them here in Philly; they do an incredible job of bringing up-and-coming indie games to their readership, and getting developers out of their caves and talking about their projects.

And if you need even more Cipher Prime excitement, [Fractal](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/fractal/) is now available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fractal-make-blooms-not-war/id479566380?mt=12) and the [Cipher Prime Store](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal)!
