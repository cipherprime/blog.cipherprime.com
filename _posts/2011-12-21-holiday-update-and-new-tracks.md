Seasons Greetings from the Cipher Prime team! [Pulse: Volume One](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/pulse/), the Holiday Edition, is available NOW! In the spirit of giving, we’ve added six new tracks with this update, bringing Pulse up to nearly an hour of original music!  Two of our favorite tracks come complimentary of two great [Gamercamp](http://www.gamercamp.ca) artists:  [Jim Guthrie](http://jimguthrie.org/) ([Sword and Sworcery](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/music)) and [6955](http://6955.org/) ([Super T.I.M.E. Force](http://www.supertimeforce.com/)).  We can’t wait to hear what you think of them!  You can also download and listen to the tracks on our [Music](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-ost) page.  We meant to get these out earlier, but have been super busy, so we thank you for your continued patience and support!
