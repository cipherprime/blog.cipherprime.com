It looked exactly like this, all the time.

180 sqft. of former candy store nestled away one block from the Italian Market, this prime piece of real estate was… too bloody small. On the average beta-testing night, we’d have three developers, 6 testers, 4 pizzas, 3 cases of Mountain Dew, and no real AC to speak of. It was an excellent starter office, but alas, we have outgrown its cozy confines.

_**And the New Office @ 239 Chestnut St!**_

This room alone is bigger than our old office.
