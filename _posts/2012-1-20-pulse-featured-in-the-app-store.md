![App Store; Music & Rhythm Games](/img/blog/music__rhythm_games.jpg "App Store; Music & Rhythm Games")

We love it when this happens. Apple threw together a selection of top “**Music & Rhythm Games”** on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443), and [Pulse: Volume One](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/pulse) made the cut! Thanks to all of our long-time supporters and all of our new players, we hope you enjoy the game!
