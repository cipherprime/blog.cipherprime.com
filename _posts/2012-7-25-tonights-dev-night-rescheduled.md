Just a quick announcement here. Tonight’s Dev Night is being moved to tomorrow night since the crew here at Cipher Prime will be partaking in [The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses](http://zelda-symphony.com/) concert tonight. Next week we’ll return to the regular Wednesday night schedule, 5pm to 1am.

If you plan on attending, there is metered parking in the area. We’re located on the second floor at 239 Chestnut Street. Press the intercom buzzer at the door and we’ll let you in. Again, the we open the doors at 5pm. See you then!
