Get ready for some fast-paced pill-dropping, color-swapping, combo-chaining, screen-exploding action!

Intake will push your hand-eye coordination to its breaking point and leave you shaking. Collect special tablets in-game to unlock ridiculous new gameplay elements. Get past level 25? Challenge levels will shake your world. Let’s bring back the arcade.

If you already got Intake during the Humble Weekly Sale, don’t worry! We’ve request Steam keys for you guys, and they’ll be available as soon as we get them.

[Intake is now available for Windows and Mac OS X on the Steam store, for $8.99 at 10% off through November 13th.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/237760/)

And if you want Intake in you earphones, check out the [Intake soundtrack on Bandcamp](http://music.cipherprime.com/album/intake-ost "Intake OST on Bandcamp")!
