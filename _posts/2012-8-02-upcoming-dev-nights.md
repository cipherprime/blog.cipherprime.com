Change in schedule folks. Starting next week, Dev Nights will be moving to Thursdays. Same time, same place. Doors open at 5pm. Game jam goes till 1am.

**Dev Night Diaries**

Looking forward, we’re going to be adding to the Dev Night format a bit. For one, we’re starting to put together Dev Night Diaries with interviews that showcase projects that developers are working on, the tools used, and approaches used to tackle the development process.

**Digital Art and Video Games**

We’re also opening up to digital artists. Each week we’ll propose an exercise geared toward learning the tools and techniques for creating game art assets and how to integrate them into [Unity](http://unity3d.com/). Much like a study group, artists will also be encouraged to study a specific aspect of the current tool set, learn it, and present it at the next Dev Night; the current tool being Pixologic’s free to use sculpting software [Sculptris](http://www.pixologic.com/sculptris/). We’ll also spend a little time each week practicing the basics with Paul Richards’ [THUMB WAR : Design Iteration Combat Simulation](http://www.autodestruct.com/thumbwar.htm).

**Ray Merkler’s _Fortress_**

Special shout out to local Philly dev Ray Merkler and his new iOS game _[Fortress](http://www.fortressthegame.com/)_, which released today! _[Fortress](http://www.fortressthegame.com/)_ is a strategy card game designed to be played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Players build a wall of soldiers to attack and destroy their opponent’s King while they try to defend their own. Simple rules belie a mountain of strategic depth!
