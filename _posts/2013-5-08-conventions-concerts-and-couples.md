**When:** Saturday, May 18th, 2013, 9:00 AM

**Where: **

University of the Arts  
Terra Hall, 16th Floor

2\. Dain’s Performing
---------------------

This Saturday, [Dain Saint](http://blog.cipherprime.com/author/dain/) will be performing at 8static, a monthly chiptune music event. This 8static will be hosting A-Rival’s _TRUTHCANNON_ album release party, and Dain will toast the evening with an all-new set of vocal-based songs. Should be awesome.
