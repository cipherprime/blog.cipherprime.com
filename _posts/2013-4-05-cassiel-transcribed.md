This blog post is dedicated to one of Cipher Prime’s favorite fans, Neil Sardesai, who recently transcribed “Cassiel,” the seventh track to [Flight of Angels](http://store.cipherprime.com/products/flight-of-angels-splice-ost), the [Splice](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice) soundtrack.

This isn’t even the first song Neil has transcribed for us; it’s _the fourth_. He’s also transcribed [Flight of Angels](http://store.cipherprime.com/products/flight-of-angels-splice-ost)‘ “[Ariel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJoAZZcbXI&list=UUEmZStSjlzER2C2IXnMI-AA&index=6)” and “[Fanuel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNsdTRD4gnI&list=UUEmZStSjlzER2C2IXnMI-AA&index=7)” and [Algorithms and Angelology](http://music.cipherprime.com/album/algorithms-and-angelology)‘s “[Phylonoe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkYHUX3haFM&list=UUEmZStSjlzER2C2IXnMI-AA&index=2).” And as Dain points out in [his recent musing about composing the Splice soundtrack](http://blog.cipherprime.com/musings/2013/04/divining-the-music-of-splice/ "Read me, I'm awesome!"), Splice’s songs are composed to be played by three pianos, making them that much more difficult to transcribe. Holy peas, Neil.

But Neil’s awesomeness transcends musicality: he’s a renaissance man and a renaissance fan. He somehow ported Pulse (available on iPads only) onto his iPhone. And he also made us this gorgeous trailer for Splice:

We tip our hats to you, Neil. You are an official Cipher Prime hero, and we’re so, so thankful to have fans like you.
