Hey guys! It has certainly been awhile. We have been working our tails off with Auditorium Customer Support and the prototype of our new game (we’ll get to that some other time). But, the most important news we have right now is being a finalist in the Mochis Awards at the [Flash Gaming Summit](http://www.flashgamingsummit.com/ "Flash Gaming Summit") in the category of [Most Creative Flash Game](http://www.flashgamingsummit.com/the-mochis.html "Most Creative Flash Game")!!! This is quite an honor for us, being chosen from over 700 nominations.

On top of being a finalist, we also have a chance at winning the peoples choice award! If you like Auditorium and would like to see it get more acclaim you can [go vote for it here to show your support](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=teDfV9kHfuJKSm6glOFJ1Q_3d_3d "Peoples Choice Award"). We’ll be flying out to California soon for this event then heading over to the GDC. So, if your in the area drop by and say hello!

One last thing, some users had been mentioning some levels taking a long time to solve. We published an update for this a few weeks ago, so if you still experience the problem please let us know. At this point, that should be completely resolved and never bother you again.
