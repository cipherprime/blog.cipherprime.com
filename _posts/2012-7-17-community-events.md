Two weeks from now, we will be discontinuing the Cipher Prime Facebook page. What a way to start off the community events post, right? Well, the important thing to know is we’re not going away. In fact, we’re going to be more present than ever!

From here on you’ll start to see more news, developer stories, and current events from the front lines at Cipher Prime. All of which will post primarily through the [Cipher Prime Blog](http://blog.cipherprime.com/) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cipherprime) feeds. By sticking to these two outlets, we can provide more and respond better to our fans.

For those in Philly, tomorrow night is Dev Night as usual. Bring your laptop loaded with [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) and [StarCraft II](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/). It’s going to be a party. Also, this Thursday is the [Philly Unity User Group](http://phillyunity.org/) meeting over at [Indie Hall](http://indyhall.org/).

Be sure to follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cipherprime) as well ([@cipherprime](http://twitter.com/cipherprime)). This week we’re tweeting three [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) codes each day, one for each of our games: [Auditorium](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205870/), [Fractal](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61310/), and [Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/).
