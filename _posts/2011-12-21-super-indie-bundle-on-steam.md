Happy Holidays!  Guess what! [Fractal](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal) is included in the [Super Indie Bundle](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/13058/), an awesome holiday deal going on in the Steam Store right now! From now until January 2nd, this bundle of ten amazing games from some super cool indie studios is available for $19.99; that’s 77% off the cost of buying all ten games!

Honestly, we’re pretty honored to be a part of this group. [LIMBO](http://limbogame.org/), from the Danish developer [Playdead](http://limbogame.org/company/), is one of the most visually pleasing games we’ve ever played. [Cave Story+](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/cave-story/id456447717?mt=12), created by Daisuke Amaya under the [Pixel](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA022293/) alias, is an updated version of the original game that has been lauded by reviewers as a milestone game in the action-adventure genre. The bundle also includes one of Will’s favorite games, [Revenge of the Titans](http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/), from [Puppy Games](http://www.puppygames.net/).  Its cutesy and retro vibe belies the intensely strategic thinking it requires of the player.  All in all it’s super fun!  The team is also really into [Gemini Rue](http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/gemini-rue.html); created by Josh Nuernberger and released by [Wadjet Eye Games](http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/), it’s a point-and-click adventure that has some outstanding, neo-noir storytelling that really sets it apart. Overall, we couldn’t be happier with everything and hope you feel the same way!  : D
