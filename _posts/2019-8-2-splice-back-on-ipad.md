Next up on the update train:  [_Splice: Tree of Life_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-tree-of-life/id543610134?mt=8) is finally back on the App Store and available for iPad! Wooooo!

_Splice_, like [_Pulse_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443), has been updated for newer iPad graphics and gotten some slight performance tweaks. Let us know how everything runs! And once again, so many thanks to everyone who participated in the iPad betaâ€”we can't wait to get everything back on the store ðŸ’—!
