We’re pushing an update that will finally link Auditorium and the Cipher Prime Store! You’ll no longer need to remember two different usernames and passwords!

The update process is very simple and streamlined — all you’ll need to do is log into your Auditorium account and follow the instructions there. If you already have a CP Store account, you’ll be able to link Auditorium; if you don’t, you’ll be able to easily create one. And all of your progress in Auditorium will still be saved.

This change also means that Auditorium will benefit from the Store’s streamlined purchase process. You’ll be able to log into the store, click the Auditorium link, and be automatically logged in — and vice-versa.

Both sites will be down for a few hours while we push this update. You can contact us anytime at [support@cipherprime.com](mailto:support@cipherprime.com) if you have any questions about the transition.
