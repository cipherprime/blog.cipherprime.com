We love games. We love making them, playing them, talking about them, licking them, etc. This weekend, one lucky Cipher Primate (the author of this post, in fact) attended PAX East, where she fangirl’d hard while helping represent the Philly dev scene.

She demoed our magically microbial game, [_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice), attended some amazing panels, made Bostonian snow angels, and met some extremely cool fellow indie developers. These creative folk included longtime Cipher Prime friends Ichiro Lambe and Rohit Shenoy of [Dejobaan Games](http://www.dejobaan.com/ "AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAwesome dudes."), Owlchemy Labs’ Alex Schwartz (of _[Snuggle Truck](http://www.smuggletruck.com/)_ fame), and Supergiant Games’ Greg Kasavin, who wrote the story to _[Bastion](http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242)_.

She also bought this so-not-emotionally-devastating T-shirt:
