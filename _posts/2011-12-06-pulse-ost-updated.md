We’ve updated the [Pulse: OST](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-ost) with four additional tracks. Now Pulse’s Catnip, High Roller, Orbital Drop, and Sahara are available for your aural enjoyment!

Here’s one of our favorites, Orbital Drop:

For those customers who have already purchased the official soundtrack, this update will be available–for free–[through our website](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-ost). All you need to do is re-download the album. If you haven’t had a chance to pick up the OST yet, all thirteen songs are [available](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-ost) for a tidy sum of two dollars!

Also, the [updated version of Fractal](http://www.cipherprime.com/2011/11/fractal-the-return-of-the-bloom/) is available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61310), the [Cipher Prime Store](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/fractal), and the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fractal-make-blooms-not-war/id479566380?mt=12), be sure to check it out if you haven’t already! (It’s awesome.) We’re also very proud of Pulse: Volume One for being listed by the App Store as a [Benchmark Game for its innovative gameplay](http://blog.cipherprime.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-01-at-2.28.29-PM1.png)!
