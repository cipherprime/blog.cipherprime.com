Hey there, old friends.

It's been a really long time since we've posted here. I mean, a while–our blog got hacked _again_, and we didn't even realize it till someone pointed it out to us. Not only was it hacked, but every post we've made is gone–we might have a backup somewhere, but honestly? It seems like it might be a good time to start fresh.

Now, there's a bunch of reasons for that. I reckon it might even be a good story–but that's for a different time.

So, today at least, I just wanted so say:

Hey. We're here. We're still making games–got a new one called [Lineweight](http://playlineweight.com), and we'll let you know when we're close to releasing it.

Lineweight's gonna mark number ten for us. Ten games, ten years. That's something to be proud of. Now, y'all might've missed some of the last couple ([Jawns](http://playjawns.com)? [Tailwind](http://playtailwind.com)?), but we're still proud to share them with you.

We know our games are busted on iOS, and we'll try and get 'em fixed up as soon as possible. In some cases, it'll be just like it was before; in others, hopefully we can make em a little better.

Outside of Cipher Prime, Will's been doing some [silly, cool experiments](https://willstall.github.io/30-days-of-shade/), and you should check 'em out. I've been working on some [music outside of games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs79aZzXVTc), just tryin' to make sense of my world, and I'd love for you to take a listen.

As for Cipher Prime...

Let's just say that, at this point in our lives, we want to take a moment to reflect; to look back at how we've been working and see what we want our future to look like. We've got some pretty dope ideas, actually, and we can't wait to share them with you. But first things first...

We've missed you. How've you been?
