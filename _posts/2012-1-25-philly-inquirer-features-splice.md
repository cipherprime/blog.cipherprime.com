[![](/img/blog/inquirer.png "inquirer")](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/tech_gaming/Cipher-Prime-Splice.html)We’ve been hinting at this game for a while now. We even showed off an early version of it at the IGDA Philly Dev Night in November. So if you’ve been wondering what “Splice” is all about, the Philadelphia Inquirer has the scoop. Check out the exposé by [Geekadelphia’s](http://geekadelphia.com/) Eric Smith in his article [A Look At Cipher Prime’s ‘Splice’](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/tech_gaming/Cipher-Prime-Splice.html).
