We don’t like to brag. We **<3** to.[![](/img/blog/PULSENUMBAONEsmall.png "PULSENUMBAONEsmall")](/img/blog/PULSENUMBAONEsmall.png)

Pulse is the **#1 Music Game** on the iPad right now, and we are so very, very happy.

But we’ll spare you the confetti, and be earnest; **we couldn’t have done this without you**.![](/img/blog/PULSENUMBAONEsmall.png)

### Without the support of _you_ – the fans – Pulse wouldn’t be half as successful as it is. Every good review, every comment, and every e-mail that comes in reminds us of that, and underscores how lucky we are to have your support.

Speaking of support, we’d like to give major props to some of our local supporters – [The GXL](http://www.thegxl.com/), [IndieGameMag](http://www.indiegamemag.com/pulse-ipad-preview/), [Philly Game Jam](http://www.phillygamejam.com/), the [IDGA](http://www.igda.org/), [Phil](http://philkahn.com/) over at [Guilded Age](http://guildedage.net/), and last but not least, [Geekadelphia](http://geekadelphia.com/2011/05/09/pulse-live-on-the-app-store-cipher-prime-looking-for-local-philly-musicians/). Philly, you’re the best home a game company could ask for.

Please, keep spreading the word about Pulse. We love you all the more for it.
