[![](/img/blog/blooms_not_war.png "blooms_not_war")](/img/blog/blooms_not_war.png)We’re pleased – _stoked_, even – to announce that after 15 long months, _Fractal_ is (very nearly) done! Head on over to [www.playfractal.com](http://www.playfractal.com) THIS VERY INSTANT to play the demo and log a high score!

To celebrate, we’re accepting pre-orders! Fractal will list for $14.99 (a dollar for every month of development), but from now until May 20th, you’ll be able to [pick it up for $9.99](https://store.cipherprime.com/promo/fractal) – $5 bucks off, or a 33% savings! Some things you might want to know about _Fractal_:

*   ****It’s Not _Bejeweled_****.**** Do you like to think? Miss “easy to learn, hard to master” gameplay? Then buddy, do we have the game for you! _Fractal_ is powered by a simple mechanic that fuels complex emergent patterns.
*   **It’s Big.** We’ve designed a deep game that tickles every part of your brain. _Fractal_ has Campaign Mode for progress junkies, Puzzle Mode for Rubik’s Cube enthusiasts, and Arcade Mode for the ADD – prepare for hours of work-destroying gameplay!
*   **It’s Downloadable.** That’s right! _Fractal_ is PC/Mac compatible, and you’ll be able to download both versions with your purchase.
*   **It’s Coming Soon.** _Fractal_ will ship in late May, so [pre-order now](https://store.cipherprime.com/promo/fractal) to get your best savings!

We absolutely have to thank each and every one of you – your support for _Auditorium_, kind words, and friendly reminders that we haven’t updated in a while remind us that we have people out there that care what we do. As always, questions and comments are welcome and encouraged.

We hope you enjoy _Fractal_!
