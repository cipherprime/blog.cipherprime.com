That’s right! Later this year, we’re going to be self-publishing [_Splice_](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice) on the PS3. This week we’re honored to be showing off Splice as part of the PlayStation booth at E3. Check out more on [our featured PlayStation blog post](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/12/splice-on-ps-an-artistic-experimental-puzzler/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PSBlog+(PlayStation.Blog)).

We’re shooting for a late summer to early fall release. We’re also hoping to include optional PlayStation Move support. Be sure to keep an eye out for Splice on the PSN!
