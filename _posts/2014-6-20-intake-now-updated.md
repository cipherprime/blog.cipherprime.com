We’ve been listening to user feedback and we’ve made some changes to Intake. We’ve been hearing that lots of people are having some problems at level 5. So to fix that, we are giving new players 5,000 mg at the start of the game. Now you can buy a life right off the bat! Also we updated Intake so that special levels start appearing at level 10, rather than level 5.

### Bug Fixes:

*   Fixed pills spawning after the death scene
*   Fixed random unlocks while in attract mode

Thanks for playing Intake! We appreciate your love and support, so let us know if you have any problems.
