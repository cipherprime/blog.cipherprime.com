Yesterday’s flood of support for our [Auditorium 2: Duet Kickstarter](http://cpri.me/A2Duet) was unprecedented, completely unexpected, and couldn’t have been more timely! Not even day-1 saw this level of support. It’s as if a prayer had been answered. In just two days, Auditorium Duet gained nearly a third of its funding, putting it back on track for success!

The moment occurred last night just after midnight EDT. Each of us listening to _The Final Countdown_ on loop while obsessively refreshing our browser windows, watching in excited disbelief  as the numbers on our Kickstarter page continued to climb. Among a twitter of tweets and Facebook posts, we watched in anxious anticipation. Against the odds, Auditroium 2: Duet met its Kickstarter funding goal of $60,000 with only 72 hours to go!

We want to thank you all for the amazing show of support, and for helping us get the word out about our Kickstarter. We couldn’t have done this without you. So as a show of gratitude, we have a couple goodies for you:
