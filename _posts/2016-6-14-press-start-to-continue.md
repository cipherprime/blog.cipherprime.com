Dear Friends and Forgers,

Firstly, youâ€™re beautiful. Yep. You. Youâ€™ve made our lives better and brighter. Which, is why this is so hard. But, letâ€™s rip off the band-aid. **As of July 1st weâ€™ll be closing down the Forge located at 239 Chestnut Street.**

For some of you, you may have just become a member. For others, you may have been here for 5 years. No matter how long, youâ€™ve probably had the chance to make some pretty cool friends. **We might be closing the Forge, but those people wonâ€™t be going anywhere.** Weâ€™re all friends and weâ€™d like to urge everyone to keep being awesome and keep supporting each other. This has always just been about the people anywayÂ ðŸ™‚

You might be wondering about Dev Night. Who would of imagined a few friends hanging out once a week would turn into a 70+ person event. Dev Night has truly become a fantastic gathering point for all us. Sadly, Dev Night will have to move too. **But, there seem to be quite a few places that would love to have our badass community**. Weâ€™ll have more news soon as it comes.

Please feel free to write us with any questions or concerns. This is also a pretty trying time for us too. So, if you have the time to offer any helpâ€“we sure could use it!

Thank you all so much!

To our bold future,  
Will and Dain

P.S.  
FOR CURRENT MEMBERS:  
We will be keeping Slack and moving over to a Patreon with a much cheaper membership fee. This money will be used to keep Dev Night running.

**If you have any personal belongings in the Forge, please remove them before the End-Of-Day Monday the 20th or get in touch with us about your items**. Weâ€™ll be selling things in the next week to help offset the shut down cost of the Forge.
