Well, we’ve got some very cool news! Development of Splice is going swimmingly and we’re happy to say that we were featured in [Kotaku’s Indie Spotlight](http://kotaku.com/5914347/the-musical-mind+bending-microbial-magic-of-splice) today!

We put up a few screenshots of our latest build on our [games page](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice/) and there’s a new gameplay trailer available through the [Kotaku article](http://kotaku.com/5914347/the-musical-mind+bending-microbial-magic-of-splice). (More media will come in the next few days.)

We can tell you that the game will feature almost a hundred strands (puzzles), many of which are dastardly difficult to solve! You’ll also be able to enjoy fourteen new Dain Saint joints that you’ll be humming all day. Splice is an incredibly immersive experience, and if you’re a puzzle person, we promise you frustration and sweet, sweet mental victories!

The game is going to be released on Steam for PC/Mac on **June 13,** and pre-orders (which will include Splice’s official soundtrack and a discount) will be available **June 6**!

Stay tuned for more Splice!
