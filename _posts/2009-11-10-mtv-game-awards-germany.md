Thank you, MTV Game Awards Germany!! Germany just loves Auditorium and we love them. Not only have we been lucky enough to be [nominated for a Game Award](http://www.mtvgameawards.de/voting.php "MTV Game Awards") we’re also in the category “Working Class Hero.” I can’t even begin to tell you how cool I think that is. I enjoy seeing any sort of love for the indie game company.

[Windosill](http://windosill.com/ "Windosill"), [Scary Girl](http://www.scarygirl.com/ "Scary Girl"), [Paper Moon](http://blurst.com/paper-moon/ "Paper Moon"), and [Little Wheel](http://www.fastgames.com/littlewheel.html "Little Wheel") were also nominated. If you haven’t had the pleasure in trying any of these great games you really should. Good luck guys, your killing it! It’s really great to see indie gaming recognized. Please checkout the entries and [vote for the indie game](http://www.mtvgameawards.de/voting.php "Vote For Indie Games") of your choice!
