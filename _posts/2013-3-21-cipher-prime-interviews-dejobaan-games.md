At a recent [Cipher Prime dev night](http://www.cipherprime.com/devnight "Dev Night is basically like your birthday and [insert Saturnalian holiday here] combined, except that it happens every week. Come."), a roomful of game-lovers and -makers had the pleasure of sitting down with Ichiro Lambe and Rohit Shenoy of [Dejobaan Games](http://www.dejobaan.com/ "*Cue flailing*") for a virtual chat. These dapper gentlemen imparted great wisdoms ranging from their personal experiences making games to their success in marketing (according to Rohit, giving games interesting names “seems to work every time”) to their mastery of the art of seduction (it’s all in the salsa, apparently).

At any rate, even if you weren’t there, you can still [watch the interview](http://youtube.com/watch?v=iWB1O2O76D8 "Watch me!")!

We’re excited to announce a new playlist on [Cipher Prime’s YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/user/cipherprimestudios "Look, Ma!
