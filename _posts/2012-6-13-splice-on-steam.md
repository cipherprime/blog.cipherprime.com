If you’re feeling up for a one of a kind puzzle experience, [play Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/)!

It’s got mysterious microbes, ingenious geometry, and perplexing puzzles. Plus, the art is beauteous and music harmonious and it’s an overall good time. If you’ve got a puzzle personality you definitely have to check this game out. Splice also won [Intel’s Level Up contest](http://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/levelup2011/) this year, for Best Puzzle Game!

The game is available for PC and Mac on [the Steam Store, for $9.99](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/). And there’s also a [soundtrack + game bundle available for $12.99](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209801/)! There’s [a demo too](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/), if you’d like to try out the first few levels.

We’ve got some ear candy from Splice on Bandcamp, called [Flight of Angels](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/album/flight-of-angels-splice-ost). Give it a listen!

We’re planning on releasing the game through our Cipher Prime store in the near future, as well, so stay tuned.

We’ve been awake for a long, long time getting the game shipped off, so please leave your comments and we’ll get back to you after some precious, precious sleep!
