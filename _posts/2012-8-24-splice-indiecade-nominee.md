**Awards!**

It seems [Splice](http://cipherprime.com/games/splice) was kissed by Lady Luck! In June, Intel announced Splice as Puzzle Genre winner of the [Intel Level Up competition](http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/showthread.php?t=105511&o=a&s=lr). In July, Penny Arcade announced Splice as one of this year’s 10 best indie games in the [PAX 10 selection](http://prime.paxsite.com/pax10#splice). We were also nominated for the [Philly Geek Awards](http://www.phillygeekawards.com/award-category/indie-game-developer-of-the-year/) as Indie Game Dev of the Year. And just this week, Splice was nominated for the [IndieCade Awards](http://www.indiecade.com/2012/nominees/)!

IndieCade is the International Festival of Independent Games, held annually during the first weekend of October in Culver City, CA. This year, 36 games have been selected, including the KickStarted [FTL: Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com/), Amanita Designs’ [Botanicula](http://botanicula.net/), and Shawn McGrath’s [DYAD](http://www.dyadgame.com/), just to name a few of our favorites.

**Kickstarter Update!**

Also, yesterday we posted a [Kickstarter update](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet/posts/293365). The post should bring everyone up to speed on where we’re at, and where we’re going in the near future. Backers also get a 66% discount on Splice!

**Dev Night!**

And last night’s [Dev Night](http://cpri.me/DevNight) was awesome! Big shout out to everyone that was able to make it. Projects are coming along wonderfully, and it was great seeing a few new faces show up as well!

Although we’re heading to PAX next week, Dev Night is still on for Thursday as usual. Aaron will be sticking around to man the fort and host. If you are going to PAX, be sure to look us up! We’ll be exhibiting [Splice](http://cipherprime.com/games/splice) for Mac, PC, and iPad at the PAX 10 booth. You can also tweet at and follow us on Twitter [@CipherPrime](http://twitter.com/cipherprime).

See you next week at PAX Prime and Dev Night!
