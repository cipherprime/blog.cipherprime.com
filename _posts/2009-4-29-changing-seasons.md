Hey everyone! We’ve received a lot of requests to put the seasonal music from the demo/lite version of Auditorium into the full game. You know what? You’re totally right! So, I’ve been thinking it would be cool to make 4 new acts, one for each season based on the levels you want to see! Please, let me know what sort of new levels you might want and we’ll try our best to come up with something for everyone.
