[](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443)WOOOOOO! After grueling labor, sleepless nights, and hours of cursing under our breath, we gave one final sweaty, heavy push – and we’re proud to introduce our baby to the world! _Pulse: Volume One_ (our third game!) is currently live, and available for purchase in the Apple App Store for 4.99 USD.

Oh yeah, forgot to mention:

Apple iPad Game of the Week! Hell yeah!

PHILLY WHAT?!!?!?

We’re thrilled. She’s beautiful. We want you all to see her, and cradle our baby in your very own arms. (It’s okay. We trust you. We know you’re great with kids.) Our switch to Unity was challenging, but we’re psyched at the outcome – it was a truly, truly satisfying experience to create our first iPad game with it. Now we can make new games faster, and for more platforms – so all our fans (_especially_ the iPad-less) can enjoy the switch.

What else are we excited about? The artists we’re going to be showcasing, in-game. We’ll be featuring free updates with brand new songs, straight from some of Philadelphia’s most talented independent artists. Pulse’s updates will be pretty eclectic – ranging from nerdcore and chiptune, to electronica and metal. But, we want more music and a bigger musical range. Where are our submissions for Rock, Pop, and Classical? [Get on that!](mailto:pulse@cipherprime.com)

But most importantly, we need to thank some people – you, our fans.
===================================================================

We love you, we really do. None of our work is possible without your support and enthusiasm. Did we mention we love you? Because we do. **And Pulse: Volume One? She loves you too.**
