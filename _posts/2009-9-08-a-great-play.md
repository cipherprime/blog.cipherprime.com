Last week, I found out about a little gem of a game called _[Canabalt](http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/ "Canabalt")_. _Canabalt_ is simply stunning. The game is a short experience, but every detail is polished to perfection. Levels are randomly generated, so you can play through quite a few times without worrying about repetitive levels. The sound design, which was done by Danny B, is perfectly tuned to the experience. Take a look at the background while your jumping from building to building, you won’t be disappointed with the atmosphere.

In _Canabalt_ there is just one control necessary, jump. The game was made for the [Experimental Gameplay Project’s](http://experimentalgameplay.com/ "Experimental Gameplay Project") ‘bare minimum theme’, but I feel like it reflects what games should be as a whole. Not only is _Canabalt_ engaging, it fits it’s audience perfectly. Usually, one doesn’t have all that much time to play internet games. When you only have a few precious minutes to spare, games like _Canabalt_ can completely engross you and take you over leaving a great memory. I would even argue that smaller bite-size experiences like this offer more long-term value, because their memory is not tainted by hours of map/level memorization. **When you play the game, you just remember how darn cool it was.**

My hat is off to [Adam Atomic](http://adamatomic.com/ "Adam Atomic"), you’ve made us rethink game design and we cannot thank you enough for the great memory we’ll keep of _Canabalt_. **If you like the game us much as us, let Adam know by sending him a donation**. Donations can be given easily from the game by clicking a little button in the bottom left hand side of the game window.
