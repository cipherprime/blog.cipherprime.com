You heard us! Over at [JayIsGames](http://www.jayisgames.com "Jay Is Games") we were lucky enough to be named as [Browser-Based Puzzle Game of the Year](http://jayisgames.com/best-of/2008/puzzle-results/ "Puzzle Game of the Year"). We cannot even tell you how much of an honor this. Hopefully, the full version will live up to the hype. But really, thats for you to decide. We have done our absolute best to make the full experience a massive upgrade from the demo. We’ve incorporated things like a level selection tool, saved solutions, optional level advance, and free-roam act completion, along with graphical and ambient enhancements. You play the game, your way. However, this is just another checkpoint for us. We’re planning on continued development for Auditorium to make it the absolute best it can be. So, we want to hear what you think. That way, we can make the game you want to see.
