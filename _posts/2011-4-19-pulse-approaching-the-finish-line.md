After lots of blood, sweat, and tears, we’re happy to say that _Pulse: Volume One_ was submitted to Apple this past weekend. What started out as an idea scratched onto a napkin is now a full-blown, living and breathing music game that will be available for your purchasing pleasure in a few short weeks. If you’re a little out of the loop, check out [Kerry’s post](../2011/03/pulse-shes-getting-there/) about the game from a few weeks ago – it’ll bring you up to speed. We’re also planning on releasing Pulse’s soundtrack once the game’s in the app store, so it’s a sweet deal all around. If you _just_ can’t wait, “[Porcelain Doll](https://store.cipherprime.com/music/porcelaindoll)” and “[Straylight](https://store.cipherprime.com/music/straylight) “are both available in our store right now.

[](http://blog.cipherprime.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/04.jpg)[![](/img/blog/02.jpg "02")](/img/blog/02.jpg)We’re really pleased that Pulse has been well-received by the press, too. Our fellow Philadelphians over at [Geekadelphia](http://geekadelphia.com/2011/04/07/cipher-primes-latest-title-pulse/) did a really nice write-up recently, and at this year’s GDC, both [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/157937/article.html) and [Pocket Gamer](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Pulse/news.asp?c=27930) showed us some love. We can’t forget about [John Polson](http://www.twitter.com/JohnPolson), who wrote this article on us for [Game Set Watch](http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/04/cipher_prime_on_ipad_and_unity.php). Check out these posts if you’re craving more info on the game; they’re all great reads, and we’re super thankful that our baby has seen such a great response.

The support from all of you fine followers and fans is what makes this job so satisfying. We’re excited that _you’re_ excited, and look forward to hearing your thoughts on the game once it’s available. Make sure you’re keeping up with our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cipherprime) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cipherprime) pages so you can find out about Pulse (and the other shenanigans going on in the studio) as they happen.
