It seems like only yesterday (hah!) that Pulse: Volume One released on the iTunes App Store.  Now 12 weeks later, it’s still rocking the App Store’s top 10 list for iPad music games!

[![](/img/blog/pulse_199_sale.png "pulse_199_sale")](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443)

To celebrate, and bring even more players to the party, we’re running a limited time sale beginning now.  If you’ve got an iPad and haven’t tried Pulse yet, now’s the time.  **We’ve reduced the price to $1.99 (60% savings over the regular $4.99 price) now through next Wednesday this Friday**.  You can get it here: [http://itunes.apple.com/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443?mt=8)

Those of you already playing Pulse and waiting for the next update, rest assured, it’s on its way.  As Kerry mentioned in our [last post](http://www.cipherprime.com/2011/07/patience-is-a-virtue/), an [IndieCade](http://www.indiecade.com) contest requirement has thrown a wrinkle into our updating plans.  That said, we’re getting the content all ready and will be pulling the trigger as soon as all’s clear with IndieCade.  This should all be happening later this month.

And, if you’re a current Pulse owner and fan, tell your friends that now’s the time to check it out at a great discount!

**Update:**

Thanks to the phenomenal response, we’ve extended the sale through Friday, August 12th!
