Not only do we currently have our [Cipher Prime Bundle](https://store.cipherprime.com/bundles/holiday) happening, we are overwhelming excited to announce the debut launch for another Philadelphia Studio: [Space Whale Studios](http://www.spacewhalestudios.com). As of yesterday, they launched their first title called “[Return All Robots](http://returnallrobots.com)” on the XBox Live Marketplace. And today, they are launching their PC version right from our very own store! This is a huge win for Philly and I’m very proud to see my friends succeed. Now, for a little look at Return All Robots:

*   [Return All Robots](https://store.cipherprime.com/games/returnallrobots) is debuting at $2.99.
*   [The (AWESOME) Soundtrack](https://store.cipherprime.com/music/returnallrobotsost) is available for $8.99.

This is a big step for us and hopefully a lasting one. This is the first of (hopefully!) many titles to be launched individually on our platform. Over the course of the next couple months we will be changing the site around and making it more studio focused, giving each developer the spotlight. If you are interested in hearing more about this or getting a game up on our store, be sure to get in touch!
