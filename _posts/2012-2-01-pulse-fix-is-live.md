![Pulse Guthrie/Leemus Fix](/img/blog/pulsejimguthriefix.jpg "Pulse Guthrie/Leemus Fix")

We’d like to thank everybody for alerting us (via emails, reviews, and homing pigeons) about the desyncing bug on one of the new [Pulse: Volume One](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/pulse/) tracks, _[Belly of the Beast](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/track/belly-of-the-beast)_, by [Jim Guthrie](http://jimguthrie.org/). We have resolved the issue and the track has been realigned with the orbits of the planets, so go update your Pulse!

Also, the artist of the track _[Pop!](http://cipherprime.bandcamp.com/track/pop)_ has been corrected to [Leemus Music](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Leemus-Music/129593640396348). Happy tapping!
