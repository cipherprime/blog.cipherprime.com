We're stoked to announce that [_Fractal: Make Blooms Not War_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fractal-make-blooms-not-war/id498291489?mt=8) is finally back on the App Store and available for iPad!

It's been too long since _Fractal_'s candy-coated math gems got some play, so let us know how everything runs! And—can't say this enough—so many thanks to everyone who participated in the iPad beta!
