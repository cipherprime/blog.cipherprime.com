That’s right! _[Splice](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/splice)_ is now available in the [Google Play store for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.splice), and we’ve already seen some great reviews!

James Gilmore at [Pocket Gamer](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Splice%3A+Tree+of+Life/news.asp?c=47093) remarks, **“_Splice_ is a minimalistic marvel, and its elegant presentation and testing challenges have helped it earn numerous accolades since its release – including our highest honour, the [Pocket Gamer Platinum Award](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Splice%3A+Tree+of+Life/review.asp?c=44650). _Splice: Tree of Life_ is a real treat for puzzle fans, and one of the best mobile games of the year.”**
