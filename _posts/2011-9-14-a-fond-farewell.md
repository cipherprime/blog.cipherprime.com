Friends,

![](/img/blog/burning_card.png "burning_card")

I’m afraid the sun has set on my time at Cipher Prime. Two weeks notice was given. Two weeks have passed. Now I must ride my bike into the distance as the credits roll.

But don’t worry!

I totally cranked out a hefty collection of baller @$$ Pulse levels before throwing in the towel. Keep an eye out for that update in the VERY NEAR FUTURE (and new levels aren’t the only thing to get excited about)!

Anyway, it’s been an extreme pleasure working with such awesome dudes and I will surely miss developing games that excite each and every one of your lovely little fingers… Now I’m headed to work for these guys: [www.punkave.com](http://www.punkave.com) (also awesome dudes).

With love from Philadelphia,

Kerry
