Who’s got six thumbs and a New and Noteworthy game in the App Store?

THESE GUYS.

We’re thrilled to announce that after grueling months of production, _Fractal : Make Blooms Not War_ is now available for your iPad! For a limited time, you can [pick it up in the app store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=qmTa3hdO86M&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ffractal-make-blooms-not-war%252Fid441272807%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30 "Fractal on iTunes") for a meager $0.99!

The official site has also moved to its new home at [cipherprime.com/games/fractal.](http://www.cipherprime.com/games/fractal) Head on over to find out more info about the new version.

In other news, we’ve been nominated in two categories at the [1st annual Philly Geek Awards](http://phillygeekawards.ericsmithrocks.com/) tonight! So we’ve got all sorts of reasons to break out the suits.
