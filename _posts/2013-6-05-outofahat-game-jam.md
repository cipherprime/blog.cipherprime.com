Hey Dev Nighters, ready for a challenge?

This Thursday’s game jam theme is “Out-of-a-Hat.” We’re going to have three hats, one containing genres, one containing styles, and one containing moods. Your assigned game will be based on whatever combination of words you pull from the hats. We believe in you.

**When:** Thursday, June 6th, 5:00 PM-5:00 AM

**Where:** Cipher Prime Studios (239 Chestnut Street, Old City)
