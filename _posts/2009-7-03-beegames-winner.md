To paraphrase [Psychotronic](http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/02/auditorium.php):[![](/img/blog/kermit-flail.gif "kermit-flail")](/img/blog/kermit-flail.gif)

AAAAAA I CAN’T HIDE IT ANY LONGER! WE WON WE WON WE WON AAAAAAAA HOLY MACARONI AAAAAAAAAA KERMIT ARMS AAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

Wow! I’m thrilled to announce that Auditorium has won the [2BeeGames Indie Game Competition](http://www.2beegames.com/)! Thanks so much to everyone that voted for us — we definitely could not have done it without you. There were so many good games in the competition; personally, I’m a big fan of [Storm](http://blog.anachronology.com/2009/05/done.html). Coded in just two weeks (!), I’d love to see what it could do with more time and funding, so I’m keeping an eye out. I also thought [Bucaneer Battle](http://www.bomtoons.com/playgame.php?id=38) was a lot of fun — great manic brawler.

Congrats to [Terence Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xt_AOs4d6o), [Edouard Mercure](http://www.edm-games.com/), and [Dream Builder Studios](http://www.dreambuilderstudios.net/)! We’re absolutely thrilled to have been in such a great competition with you guys.

And once again, to everyone that voted, everyone that reads the blog, and everyone that supports us — we 100% could not have done this without you! You’re the best fans in the world.

Okay, I’d seriously better stop before I go into a tearful “I’d like to thank the academy…”. If you’re Stateside, have a great 4th of July Weekend!
