For all you tuned-in cats, we’ve been having a rather… interesting time these past two days. We had to postpone the Fractal Launch until this afternoon because of server related issues yesterday. Today, [Media Temple was DDoS’d](http://twitter.com/MediaTemple "Media Temple Twitter Account") and we were thrown for another loop. Internally, we’ve been having stupid issues with Windows 7 permissions and uninstalls. Fast forward to 12:14 AM EST, and we’ve obliterated all our nice little “obstacles” with a smile on our face ready to say, **“You can now download Fractal from the [Cipher Prime Store](http://store.cipherprime.com "Cipher Prime Store").”**

We will be posting an Official Announcement tomorrow along with a reminder email for everyone who preordered or is a part of the mailing list.

[![](/img/blog/fractal_install_screenshot.png "Fractal Install")](/img/blog/fractal_install_screenshot.png)**If you preordered you’ll also notice a nice freebie in your account.** Dain whipped you ladies and gents up a sexy Fractal Theme. Since you love us enough to preorder, we love you enough to give you something a little extra. For anyone who missed the preorder, the track will also be available for $0.99 at [www.playfractal.com](http://www.playfractal.com "Play Fractal")

Thank you so much for all your patience. As with any release, I’m sure there will be bugs. Please shoot an email to [support@cipherprime.com](mailto:support@cipherprime.com "Contact Cipher Prime Support") and we’ll do everything we can to help!

_Thanks from the Fractal Team (Will, Dain, and Ben)!_
