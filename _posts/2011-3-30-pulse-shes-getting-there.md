As you may have gathered, it’s been an extremely busy couple of months for the gang here at Cipher Prime. In between perspiration-inducing bouts of Starcraft and Dain’s all-too-frequent group demonstrations of the Insanity Workout program, we’ve been laboring tirelessly on our baby girl, _Pulse_.

As CP’s designated content developer and resident hipster (according to my business card), it’s been my task to build levels for this sweet little cherub of a game. On top of that, I’ve had the immense pleasure of co-composing Pulse’s soundtrack with Dain.

Only days after Will first scribbled a few rings on a dirty paper napkin, (when little Pulse was conceived) Dain and I were banging away on our MIDI keyboards, searching for the right tunes to compliment our baby’s delicious gameplay. After a bit of deliberation and experimentation we landed on a scatterbrained assortment of orchestral arrangements, 80’s dance riots, chiptune fusion, and pirate shanties.

We had the chance to show off Pulse a bit at this years [Game Developer’s Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco. That went well, and we were lucky enough to get some feedback in articles from by **Tracy Erickson** from [Pocket Gamer](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Pulse/news.asp?c=27930) who called Pulse, “_a package so thoroughly well put together that you’re reminded of why music games were popular in the first place._” and **Chris Holt** from [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/157937/2011/03/pulse.html) who said that Pulse was a, “_remarkable rhythm game_” in his feature.

**Anyway, here’s the scoop**:

Pulse will be released sometime in the NEAR future with 7 core levels for just $4.99 through the iTunes App Store- how sweet is that? These will be made up of the aforementioned collection of songs that big D and I have been tag-teamin’ for the past couple months. We’ve already released one track called “Porcelain Doll,” which was really well received**. Now, we’re excited to release our second track called “Straylight**,” available through the [Cipher Prime Store for $0.99](https://store.cipherprime.com/music/straylight). Both tracks have an ethereal quality that hint at a magical world.

And it doesn’t stop there! Every week, Cipher Prime will release a new track collaborated with local Philadelphia artists that makes Pulse a lot more interesting. We’re excited to announce our new rhythm-based game, while being able to promote the independent local music scene at the same time. Unfortunately, I’m going to have to keep you guessing for another few days before we unveil our next bit of juicy news. I will, however, leave you with the following three words: Mountain, Bounce, Godzilla.

Having read all that, try and tell me your ears aren’t tingling with anticipation.
