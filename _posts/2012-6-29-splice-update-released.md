Updates to [Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790), [Splice Demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790), and [Splice Soundtrack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209801/) released on Steam this week. The updates are applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted.

Major changes include the following:

*   Fixed all issues related to unlocking achievements. With this update, any achievement that was previously earned but not unlocked will automatically unlock upon entering the game. This includes any achievement earned while playing the Splice Demo. Achievements are not supported for the demo, but will unlock automatically upon running the full version of Splice.
*   Added support for Steam Cloud. All progress is now saved to the cloud, including any progress made prior to this update. This feature is supported in both the demo and the full version of Splice.
*   Added FLAC (in addition to MP3) format audio files to the Splice Soundtrack DLC.

To access the Splice Soundtrack DLC audio files, navigate to the Splice install directory.
