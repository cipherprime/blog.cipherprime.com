Hey guys! We are beyond thrilled to announce that after, like, _entirely too long_, [_Pulse: Volume One_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443) is finally back on the App Store and available for iPad! We've had our heads pretty deep in finishing our new title _Lineweight_, and we can only spin so many plates (despite how good at juggling Will is). So before _Lineweight_ comes out, we want to get our proverbial house in order.

_Pulse_ has everything you remember, along with Retina-updated graphics and some slight performance tweaks. We've been really sad that it hasn't been up, but people kept writing in to ask when it would be available again, which is honestly the best kind of love and support we could hope to ask for. This is the first of quite a few updates coming out from CP, so let us know what you think! And thanks so much to everyone who participated in the iPad betaâ€”your help really means so much to us, and we couldn't have done it without you ðŸ’—!
