**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

_After listening to your concerns, we’ve decided that making customers pay again for an app they’ve already purchased is too much to ask. We’ve decided to make Fractal** free** on iTunes through this Friday. We’ve just made the change, so it may take a little while to propagate to your region. Thanks for your understanding and support!_

[![](/img/blog/fractal_ipad_rerelease.png "fractal_ipad_rerelease")](/img/blog/fractal_ipad_rerelease.png)After the [unfortunate mess with our publisher](http://www.cipherprime.com/2012/01/fractal-pulled-from-itunes-app-store/), Fractal for the iPad is [back up on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fractal-make-blooms-not-war/id498291489?mt=8), along with a bunch of bug fixes! It now runs beautifully on the iPad 1 (i.e. does not crash anymore!).

We wanted to be able to simply transfer our fans’ existing Fractal purchase records (for the Fractal under our old publisher’s name) to the current Fractal (the version released under our name). Unfortunately, that’s not possible under the App Store’s current architecture, so we were faced with a difficult pricing choice.

We’ve decided that Fractal will continue to be a paid app, though for this week (ending next Tuesday, February 21) we are reducing the price to 99 cents. After that, Fractal will return to its original price.

**There are several options for previous customers.**

*   **One**: You can simply keep your current version of Fractal; however, it will not be updated and you will not be able to reinstall it, because that version of Fractal is no longer in the App Store.
*   **Two**: You can repurchase Fractal at the reduced 99¢ price this week. Each purchase of will really help us out, and will allow you to reinstall and update the app in the future. We _hate_ to ask this of our fans, but we have to try and make our plea. The circumstances that forced the removal of Fractal from the App Store to begin with have made it so that we can’t afford to offer it for free. We, more than anyone, wish things had turned out differently.
*   **Three**: if you _still_ think having to repurchase the app for updates is unfair, please contact us directly and we can try and work something out.

We truly apologize for this unexpected mess. We are not trying to squeeze pennies out of our customers, we are just trying to recoup on business losses from a bad publishing deal. We’re sorry, and hope you can understand where we’re coming from. We love you guys and hope we have your continued support!

**Patch Notes for Fractal v1.2.0 (iPad):**

*   Performance improvements across the board, especially on iPad 1.
*   Reduced the memory footprint of the entire game.
*   Removed some assets that were no longer being used.
*   Reduced the overall CPU usage of the game.
*   Fixed a logic error that could render puzzle 53 unsolvable.
*   Fixed some bugs that unbalanced arcade mode. The difficulty curve in Run was too sharp and was knocking people out of it sooner than they should be.
*   Fixed the apparent size of some of the levels in campaign mode.
